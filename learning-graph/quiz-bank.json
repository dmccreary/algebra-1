      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A variable is a symbol (usually a letter) that represents an unknown or changing value. Variables are what make algebra powerful—they let us work with values we don't know yet or values that can change. Option A describes a constant, not a variable.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The distributive property shows that $a(b + c) = ab + ac$. In this example, $3(4 + 2) = 3 \\times 4 + 3 \\times 2$ demonstrates distributing the multiplication of 3 over the addition inside the parentheses. Option A shows the commutative property, option C shows the associative property, and option D shows the identity property.",
