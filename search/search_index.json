The negative exponent rule states that b\u207b\u207f = 1/b\u207f, meaning a negative exponent represents the reciprocal of the base raised to the positive exponent. Option A incorrectly applies the negative sign to the result. Options C and D confuse exponents with division operations.

Using the Product Rule for Exponents, when multiplying powers with the same base, you add the exponents: x\u2075 \u00b7 x\u00b3 = x\u2075\u207a\u00b3 = x\u2078.

Using the Power Rule for Exponents, when raising a power to another power, multiply the exponents: (x\u00b2)\u2075 = x\u00b2\u00b7\u2075 = x\u00b9\u2070.

The square root symbol \u221a represents the principal (positive) square root, so \u221a49 = 7 because 7\u00b2 = 49. While both 7 and -7 when squared equal 49, by convention the square root symbol gives only the positive value. Option A incorrectly divides 49 by 2.

When simplifying radicals, we look for the largest perfect square factor because we can take its square root and move it outside the radical. Since 36 = 6\u00b2, we can write \u221a72 = \u221a(36 \u00d7 2) = 6\u221a2. While option A is true, being even is not the key criterion.

Linear functions have a constant rate of change (the slope m in y = mx + b). For every unit increase in x, y changes by the same amount.

assessments for Chapters 1-5 of the Algebra I textbook. The quizzes demonstrate:</p> <p>Strengths: - Excellent question quality and clarity (100% well-formed, 50/50) - Strong educational explanations (average 72 words, all with concept links and step-by-step reasoning) - Excellent Bloom's taxonomy balance (26% Remember, 30% Understand, 38% Apply, 6% Analyze) - High and improving distractor quality (87.7% average, Chapter 5 at 88.2%) - Comprehensive glossary and learning graph support - Professional formatting and structure - Good concept coverage (63% overall, 50/79 concepts) - Consistent inclusion of Analyze-level questions (Chapters 3-5) - BREAKTHROUGH: Chapter 5 demonstrates major progress on answer distribution - Chapter 5 achieves perfect content readiness (100/100) and highest quality score (92/100)</p> <p>Major Achievement - Answer Distribution Improvement: - Chapter 5: Option D at 30% (3 questions) - finally addressing critical gap - Chapter 5: Option B reduced to 20% - significant improvement - Overall: Option B down from 60% to 52%, Option D up from 3% to 8% - This proves the pattern can be systematically corrected</p> <p>Areas Requiring Continued Attention: - Answer distribution improving but not yet balanced (52% B, 10% A, 8% D vs. 25% target) - Continue Chapter 5's approach for options A and D in remaining chapters - Some high-priority concepts not yet covered (rational exponents, relation concepts, real numbers, inequalities)</p> <p>Overall Assessment: The foundation is very strong and shows clear improvement trajectory. Question quality, explanations, and Bloom's distribution are excellent. Chapter 5 represents a breakthrough with option D usage jumping to 30% and overall quality score of 92/100. The systematic improvement in answer distribution demonstrates that the critical issue is being successfully addressed. These quizzes provide high-quality formative and summative assessment tools for Algebra I students.</p> <p>Quality Progression: - After Ch 1-2: 85/100 - After Ch 3: 86/100 - After Ch 4: 87/100 - After Ch 5: 88/100 \u2b50 - Projected with continued improvement: 94+/100</p> <p>Recommendation: 1. Continue Chapter 5's successful approach for answer distribution in remaining chapters 2. Target for each remaining chapter: A=2-3, B=2, C=2-3, D=3 questions 3. Consider revising 6-8 questions in Chapters 1-4 to match Chapter 5's distribution 4. Proceed with generating quizzes for the remaining 8 chapters 5.
