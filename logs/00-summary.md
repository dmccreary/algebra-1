## Next Steps for Full Content Generation

### For Chapters 5-7:

Each summary file (`logs/ch-05.md`, `logs/ch-06.md`, `logs/ch-07.md`) contains:

1. **Complete concept list** - All concepts that must be covered
2. **Recommended content structure** - Sections with estimated word counts
3. **Interactive element specifications** - Detailed MicroSim descriptions
4. **Key formulas** - All equations to include with LaTeX formatting
5. **Required tables** - Structure and content for each table
6. **Real-world connections** - Application contexts
7. **Common errors to address** - Student misconceptions
8. **Content generation notes** - Specific guidance

### To Generate Full Content:

Use the summary files as blueprints and follow the same pattern as Chapters 2-4:

1. Read the summary file for the chapter
2. Follow the recommended structure
3. Apply all quality standards (LaTeX, markdown, reading level)
4. Create detailed MicroSim specifications in `<details markdown="1">` blocks
5. Include all concepts from the list
6. Add Key Takeaways section
7. Verify all concepts covered

## Recommended Workflow for Completing Chapters 5-7

### Phase 1: Generate Full Content
For each chapter (5, 6, 7):
1. Open the summary file (e.g., `logs/ch-05.md`)
2. Use it as a detailed outline
3. Generate full educational content following the structure
4. Apply all quality standards from Chapters 2-4

### Phase 2: Implement Interactive Elements
For each MicroSim:
1. Use the detailed specifications from content
2. Implement using p5.js or specified technology
3. Test functionality
4. Ensure learning objectives are met

### Phase 3: Review and Polish
1. Verify all concepts covered
2. Check reading level consistency
3. Validate all LaTeX renders correctly
4. Test all cross-references
5. Ensure progressive difficulty
