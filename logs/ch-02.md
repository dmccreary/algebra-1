## LaTeX Equations Used

All equations formatted with LaTeX surrounded by single dollar signs:

- Set notation: $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{R}$
- Fraction notation: $\frac{p}{q}$
- Exponent notation: $b^n$, $10^2$
- Properties: $a + b = b + a$, $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$, $a(b + c) = ab + ac$
- Absolute value: $|a|$, piecewise definition
- Distance formula: $d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$
- Ordered pairs: $(x, y)$

## Pedagogical Approach

- **Progression:** Concrete to abstract (numbers → properties → applications)
- **Reading Level:** Senior High - mixed sentence structures (15-22 words average), technical vocabulary with definitions, balance of concrete and abstract examples
- **Engagement:** Interactive elements every 2-4 paragraphs
- **Connections:** Frequent references to future chapters and real-world applications
- **Visual Support:** Rich mix of tables, lists, diagrams, and interactive elements

## Skills Required for Interactive Elements

To implement the interactive elements, the following skills would be needed:

1. **microsim-p5** - For all 5 MicroSims (integer operations, distributive property, properties game, absolute value, coordinate plotter)
2. **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - For the rational number classification infographic
3. **SVG/Canvas graphics** - For the number systems hierarchy diagram

## Quality Metrics

- **Blank lines before lists:** ✓ All lists have blank lines
- **Blank lines before tables:** ✓ All tables have blank lines
- **LaTeX formatting:** ✓ All equations use single dollar signs
- **Variable definitions:** ✓ All equations have "where:" sections
- **Detail blocks:** ✓ All complex elements use `<details markdown="1">` format
- **Comprehensive specifications:** ✓ All MicroSims and diagrams have detailed implementation specs

## Notes

The chapter successfully introduces foundational concepts while maintaining accessibility for the target grade level (8-10). The interactive elements are designed to:

- Allow student progress tracking
- Provide immediate feedback
- Enable hands-on exploration of abstract concepts
- Support multiple learning styles (visual, kinesthetic, logical)

The content bridges from Chapter 1 (Foundations of Algebra) and prepares students for Chapter 3 (Exponents and Powers) by introducing basic exponent terminology.
