## Content Structure

### Pedagogical Approach

Content was organized in pedagogical order (simple to complex) rather than strictly following the concept list order:

1. **Introduction** - Establishes why algebra matters and how it differs from arithmetic
2. **Building Blocks** - Numbers → Variables → Constants → Coefficients → Terms → Expressions
3. **Relationships** - Equations → Inequalities
4. **Operations** - Order of Operations → Evaluating → Substitution
5. **Manipulation** - Like Terms → Combining → Simplifying → Expanding
6. **Special Topics** - Monomials → Prime Factorization
7. **Summary** - Key takeaways and looking ahead
