## Notes

Chapter 4 successfully transitions from polynomial basics (Chapter 3) to full polynomial manipulation. The content emphasizes both procedural fluency (operations) and pattern recognition (special products), preparing students for the deeper factoring work in Chapter 5.

The three MicroSims provide complementary learning experiences:
1. Classification tool builds foundational understanding
2. FOIL visualizer develops procedural fluency
3. Matching game connects forward (multiplication) and reverse (factoring) processes

Word problems section introduces practical applications using polynomial expressions, reinforcing that these aren't just abstract manipulations but tools for modeling real situations.
