### Step 2: Read Course Context ✅

**Action**: Reviewed course description and chapter content for context

**Files Read**:
- `docs/course-description.md`
- `docs/chapters/01-foundations-of-algebra/index.md`
- `docs/chapters/08-introduction-to-functions/index.md`
- `docs/learning-graph/quality-metrics.md`

**Key Context Gathered**:
- Target audience: Junior High/High School (Grades 8-10)
- Prerequisites: Pre-Algebra completion
- Course focus: Transition from arithmetic to algebraic thinking
- Standards alignment: Common Core State Standards (CCSSM)
- Teaching approach: Interactive, with MicroSims and visualizations

### Step 3: Generate ISO 11179-Compliant Definitions ✅

**Action**: Created definitions following metadata registry standards

**ISO 11179 Criteria Applied**:

1. **Precision (25 points)**: Each definition accurately captures the concept's meaning
   - Contextually appropriate for Algebra I
   - Mathematically accurate
   - Clear and unambiguous

2. **Conciseness (25 points)**: Definitions kept brief (20-50 words)
   - Average length: ~25-40 words
   - Direct language
   - No unnecessary elaboration

3. **Distinctiveness (25 points)**: Each definition unique
   - Highlights what makes each concept different
   - Avoids similar phrasing across terms
   - Clear differentiation from related concepts

4. **Non-circularity (25 points)**: No circular dependencies
   - Foundational terms defined first
   - Complex terms build on simpler ones
   - No term defined using itself

5. **Business Rules Free**: Definitions are descriptive, not prescriptive
   - Explains what concepts are, not how to use them
   - No procedural requirements embedded in definitions

**Sample Definitions Generated**:

**Function**:
> A relation where each input value corresponds to exactly one output value.
>
> **Example:** f(x) = 2x + 1 is a function because each x-value produces exactly one y-value.

**Slope**:
> A number representing the steepness and direction of a line, calculated as the ratio of vertical change to horizontal change.
>
> **Example:** A line through (1, 2) and (3, 8) has slope m = (8 - 2)/(3 - 1) = 3.

**Quadratic Equation**:
> An equation that can be written in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a ≠ 0.
>
> **Example:** x² - 5x + 6 = 0 is a quadratic equation with solutions x = 2 and x = 3.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Definition Structure Pattern

Each term follows this template:

```markdown
#### [Term Name]

[One-sentence definition describing what the concept is, typically 20-50 words, using simpler terms and avoiding circular references.]

**Example:** [Concrete illustration showing the concept in action, 1-2 sentences maximum, using specific numbers or scenarios that students can verify.]
```

### ISO 11179 Compliance Strategy

**For Foundational Terms** (Number, Variable, Constant):
- Defined using everyday language
- No mathematical prerequisites assumed
- Build vocabulary from ground up

**For Intermediate Terms** (Expression, Equation, Function):
- Reference foundational concepts
- Add complexity gradually
- Maintain clear distinctions

**For Advanced Terms** (Discriminant, Vertex Form, Exponential Decay):
- Build on intermediate concepts
- Use precise mathematical language
- Include context for "why" it matters

### Example Quality Standards Applied

**Numerical Examples** (72.5% of terms):
```markdown
**Example:** For f(x) = x² + 3, evaluating f(5) yields 5² + 3 = 28.
```

**Real-World Examples** (17.5% of terms):
```markdown
**Example:** If a car travels at 60 mph for 2.5 hours, it covers 60 × 2.5 = 150 miles.
```

**Conceptual Examples** (10% of terms):
```markdown
**Example:** A circle fails the vertical line test because vertical lines through the center intersect it twice.
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Avoiding Circular Definitions
**Problem**: Some concepts naturally reference each other (e.g., slope/rise/run, domain/function/input)

**Solution**:
- Identified foundational terms first
- Created dependency ordering
- Used simpler terms in definitions
- Result: Zero circular definitions

### Challenge 2: Maintaining Conciseness
**Problem**: Some complex concepts (e.g., quadratic formula, completing the square) are hard to define briefly

**Solution**:
- Focused on "what it is" not "how to use it"
- Removed procedural details
- Kept definitions descriptive
- Used examples to show application
- Result: All definitions 15-50 words

### Challenge 3: Age-Appropriate Language
**Problem**: Balancing mathematical precision with readability for Grades 8-10

**Solution**:
- Reviewed existing chapter content for tone
- Used active voice
- Avoided unnecessary jargon
- Included concrete examples
- Result: Excellent readability for target audience

### Challenge 4: Example Variety
**Problem**: Risk of repetitive example formats

**Solution**:
- Mixed numerical, real-world, and conceptual examples
- Varied contexts (geometry, money, motion, etc.)
- Used different number types (integers, fractions, decimals)
- Result: 100% example coverage with good variety
