## LaTeX Equations Used

Extensive use of LaTeX throughout the chapter:

- Exponent notation: $b^n$, $2^3$, $(-5)^2$, $-5^2$
- Zero exponent: $b^0 = 1$
- Negative exponents: $b^{-n} = \frac{1}{b^n}$
- Rational exponents: $b^{1/n} = \sqrt[n]{b}$, $b^{m/n} = \sqrt[n]{b^m}$
- Product rule: $b^m \cdot b^n = b^{m+n}$
- Quotient rule: $\frac{b^m}{b^n} = b^{m-n}$
- Power rule: $(b^m)^n = b^{m \cdot n}$
- Power of product: $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$
- Power of quotient: $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}$
- Scientific notation: $a \times 10^n$
- Square root: $\sqrt{a} = b$ means $b^2 = a$
- Cube root: $\sqrt[3]{a} = b$ means $b^3 = a$
- Radical expressions: $\sqrt[n]{a}$
- Product property: $\sqrt[n]{a \cdot b} = \sqrt[n]{a} \cdot \sqrt[n]{b}$
- Polynomial general form: $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0$

## Notes

The chapter successfully builds from basic exponent understanding to sophisticated manipulation of exponential expressions. The five MicroSims provide hands-on exploration of abstract concepts:

1. **Explorer** - Builds intuition for different exponent types
2. **Laws Game** - Develops procedural fluency with rules
3. **Scientific Notation Tool** - Practical application for extreme numbers
4. **Radical Simplification** - Visual factorization for conceptual understanding
5. **Polynomial Game** - Classification practice for upcoming chapter

The content maintains appropriate reading level while introducing significant mathematical sophistication. The emphasis on "why" (derivations) alongside "how" (procedures) supports deep understanding rather than rote memorization.
