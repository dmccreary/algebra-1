## Recommended Content Structure

### 1. Introduction (300 words)
- Connection to Chapter 4 (multiplication → factoring)
- Real-world applications (finding dimensions from area)
- Preview of solving equations by factoring

### 2. Factoring Strategies (2,000 words)

**Factoring by GCF:**
- Review from Chapter 4
- Multiple variables and higher powers
- Examples: 12x³y² - 18x²y³ + 6xy

**Factoring Trinomials:**
- When a = 1: x² + bx + c
  - Find two numbers that multiply to c and add to b
  - Example: x² + 7x + 12 = (x + 3)(x + 4)
- When a ≠ 1: ax² + bx + c
  - AC method or trial and error
  - Example: 2x² + 7x + 3 = (2x + 1)(x + 3)

**Factoring Special Products:**
- Difference of squares: a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)
- Perfect square trinomials:
  - a² + 2ab + b² = (a + b)²
  - a² - 2ab + b² = (a - b)²
- Sum of cubes: a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²)
- Difference of cubes: a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²)

**Factoring by Grouping:**
- Four-term polynomials
- Group in pairs, factor out GCF from each
- Example: ax + ay + bx + by = a(x + y) + b(x + y) = (a + b)(x + y)

**Factoring Completely:**
- Always factor out GCF first
- Continue until all factors are prime
- Check by multiplying back

**Factoring Quadratic Form:**
- Expressions like x⁴ + 5x² + 6
- Substitute u = x²: u² + 5u + 6
- Factor: (u + 2)(u + 3)
- Substitute back: (x² + 2)(x² + 3)

### 3. Zero Product Property and Solving (800 words)

**Zero Product Property:**
- If a · b = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0
- Foundation for solving by factoring

**Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring:**
1. Set equation equal to zero
2. Factor completely
3. Apply zero product property
4. Solve each resulting equation
5. Check solutions

Examples:
- x² + 5x + 6 = 0 → (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0 → x = -2 or x = -3
- 2x² - 5x = 3 → 2x² - 5x - 3 = 0 → (2x + 1)(x - 3) = 0

### 4. Introduction to Relations and Functions (800 words)

**Relations:**
- Set of ordered pairs
- Can be represented as: table, graph, mapping, set notation
- Domain: set of all inputs
- Range: set of all outputs

**Independent and Dependent Variables:**
- Independent variable (input): usually x, the variable you control
- Dependent variable (output): usually y, depends on x
- Notation: y depends on x

**Input and Output:**
- Input: value substituted into a relation
- Output: resulting value
- Example: For y = 2x + 1, if input is 3, output is 7

**Discrete Functions:**
- Functions with separate, distinct points
- Not continuous
- Example: Number of students (can't be 25.5 students)
- Graph shows individual points, not connected lines

### 5. Applications and Problem Solving (400 words)

## Key Equations and Formulas

All with proper LaTeX formatting and "where:" definitions:

- GCF: $ax + ay = a(x + y)$
- Difference of squares: $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$
- Perfect square: $(a \pm b)^2 = a^2 \pm 2ab + b^2$
- Sum of cubes: $a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)$
- Difference of cubes: $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$
- Zero product property: If $ab = 0$, then $a = 0$ or $b = 0$
