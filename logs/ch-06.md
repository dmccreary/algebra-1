- Balance analogy (scales)
- Importance in real-world problem solving
- Overview of systematic solving process

### 2. Building Equation-Solving Skills (2,200 words)

**One-Step Equations:**
- Addition/subtraction equations
  - $x + 5 = 12$ → $x = 7$
  - $x - 3 = 10$ → $x = 13$
- Multiplication/division equations
  - $3x = 15$ → $x = 5$
  - $\frac{x}{4} = 7$ → $x = 28$
- Inverse operations concept

**Two-Step Equations:**
- General form: $ax + b = c$
- Strategy: Undo addition/subtraction first, then multiplication/division
- Examples:
  - $2x + 5 = 13$ → $2x = 8$ → $x = 4$
  - $\frac{x}{3} - 7 = 2$ → $\frac{x}{3} = 9$ → $x = 27$

**Multi-Step Equations:**
- Combine like terms first
- Distribute when necessary
- Use properties strategically
- Examples:
  - $3(x - 2) + 4 = 16$
  - $2x + 5 - x + 3 = 12$

**Variables on Both Sides:**
- Collect variables on one side
- Collect constants on the other
- Examples:
  - $5x + 3 = 2x + 15$ → $3x = 12$ → $x = 4$
  - $7x - 4 = 3x + 8$ → $4x = 12$ → $x = 3$

**Equations with Fractions:**
- Method 1: Clear fractions by multiplying by LCD
- Method 2: Work with fractions directly
- Examples:
  - $\frac{x}{3} + \frac{x}{4} = 7$ → Multiply by 12
  - $\frac{2x + 1}{5} = 3$ → Multiply by 5

**Equations with Decimals:**
- Method 1: Clear decimals by multiplying by power of 10
- Method 2: Work with decimals using calculator
- Examples:
  - $0.5x + 0.3 = 1.8$ → Multiply by 10
  - $2.5x - 1.2 = 3.8$

### 3. Literal Equations and Formulas (800 words)

**Literal Equations:**
- Equations with multiple variables
- Solving for a specified variable
- Use same properties as with numbers

**Common Formulas to Manipulate:**
- Perimeter: $P = 2l + 2w$ → solve for $l$ or $w$
- Area of triangle: $A = \frac{1}{2}bh$ → solve for $b$ or $h$
- Distance: $d = rt$ → solve for $r$ or $t$
- Temperature: $F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32$ → solve for $C$
- Simple interest: $I = Prt$ → solve for $P$, $r$, or $t$

**Steps for Solving Literal Equations:**
1. Identify the variable to isolate
2. Use inverse operations
3. Treat other variables as constants
4. Simplify the result

Examples:
- Solve $A = \frac{1}{2}bh$ for $h$: $h = \frac{2A}{b}$
- Solve $P = 2l + 2w$ for $w$: $w = \frac{P - 2l}{2}$

### 4. Types of Solutions (500 words)

**Conditional Equations:**
- Most equations
- True for specific value(s) only
- Example: $2x + 3 = 7$ → $x = 2$ (one solution)

**Identity Equations:**
- Always true
- All real numbers are solutions
- Solution set: $\mathbb{R}$ or "all real numbers"
- Example: $2(x + 3) = 2x + 6$ → $2x + 6 = 2x + 6$ (true for all $x$)

**Contradictions:**
- Never true
- No solutions
- Solution set: $\emptyset$ (empty set) or "no solution"
- Example: $x + 5 = x + 3$ → $5 = 3$ (false)

**Recognition Strategy:**
- Solve normally
- If variables cancel and statement is TRUE → identity
- If variables cancel and statement is FALSE → contradiction
- If you get $x = \text{number}$ → conditional

### 5. Checking Solutions (400 words)

**Why Check Solutions:**
- Verify correctness
- Catch arithmetic errors
- Understand solution meaning

**How to Check:**
1. Substitute solution back into original equation
2. Simplify both sides
3. Verify both sides are equal

**Examples:**
- Check $x = 4$ in $3x + 5 = 17$:
  - $3(4) + 5 = 17$
  - $12 + 5 = 17$
  - $17 = 17$ ✓
