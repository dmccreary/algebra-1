## Recommended Content Structure

### 1. Introduction (250 words)
- Difference between equations and inequalities
- Real-world contexts (budgets, speed limits, temperature ranges)
- Preview of graphing solutions on number line

### 2. Understanding Inequality Symbols (400 words)

**The Four Inequality Symbols:**

| Symbol | Meaning | Example | Read As |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| $<$ | Less than | $x < 5$ | x is less than 5 |
| $>$ | Greater than | $x > 3$ | x is greater than 3 |
| $\leq$ | Less than or equal to | $x \leq 7$ | x is less than or equal to 7 |
| $\geq$ | Greater than or equal to | $x \geq 2$ | x is greater than or equal to 2 |

**Key Differences from Equations:**
- Equations have one solution (usually)
- Inequalities have infinitely many solutions (a range)
- Solution is represented as an interval

- Closed circle (●) for ≤ and ≥ (included)
- Arrow showing direction of solutions

### 3. Solving Linear Inequalities (800 words)

**Properties of Inequalities:**
- Addition Property: If $a < b$, then $a + c < b + c$
- Subtraction Property: If $a < b$, then $a - c < b - c$
- Multiplication Property (positive): If $a < b$ and $c > 0$, then $ac < bc$
- **CRITICAL: Multiplication Property (negative):** If $a < b$ and $c < 0$, then $ac > bc$ (FLIP THE SIGN!)
- Division Property: Same as multiplication

**Solving Process:**
1. Simplify each side (combine like terms, distribute)
2. Collect variable terms on one side
3. Collect constants on other side
4. Isolate the variable
5. **If you multiply or divide by negative, flip the inequality sign**
6. Graph the solution

**Examples:**

Simple inequality:
- $x + 5 > 12$
- $x > 7$
- Graph: Open circle at 7, arrow right

With negative coefficient:
- $-3x \leq 15$
- $x \geq -5$ (sign flipped!)
- Graph: Closed circle at -5, arrow right

Multi-step:
- $2(x - 3) + 5 < x + 7$
- $2x - 6 + 5 < x + 7$
- $2x - 1 < x + 7$
- $x < 8$

### 4. Compound Inequalities (700 words)

**And Inequalities (Intersection):**
- Both conditions must be true
- Written as: $a < x < b$ or $x > a$ AND $x < b$
- Solution is the overlap
- Graph shows where both are true

Examples:
- $x > 2$ AND $x < 7$ → $2 < x < 7$
- Graph: Open circles at 2 and 7, line between them
- Interval notation: $(2, 7)$

Solving:
- $3 < 2x + 1 < 11$
- Subtract 1 from all three parts: $2 < 2x < 10$
- Divide all by 2: $1 < x < 5$

**Or Inequalities (Union):**
- At least one condition must be true
- Written as: $x < a$ OR $x > b$
- Solution includes both regions
- Graph shows both separate parts

Examples:
- $x < -2$ OR $x > 5$
- Graph: Arrow left from -2 (open), arrow right from 5 (open)
- Interval notation: $(-\infty, -2) \cup (5, \infty)$

Solving:
- $2x + 3 < -5$ OR $2x + 3 > 5$
- First: $x < -4$
- Second: $x > 1$
- Solution: $x < -4$ OR $x > 1$

### 5. Absolute Value Review (300 words)

**Geometric Meaning:**
- Distance from zero on number line
- Always non-negative
- $|x| = x$ if $x \geq 0$
- $|x| = -x$ if $x < 0$

**Examples:**
- $|5| = 5$
- $|-5| = 5$
- $|0| = 0$

### 6. Absolute Value Equations (600 words)

**Pattern:** $|x| = a$ where $a \geq 0$

**Solution Strategy:**
- If $|x| = a$, then $x = a$ OR $x = -a$
- Two solutions (unless a = 0)

**Examples:**

Basic:
- $|x| = 7$ → $x = 7$ or $x = -7$

With expression inside:
- $|x - 3| = 5$
- Case 1: $x - 3 = 5$ → $x = 8$
- Case 2: $x - 3 = -5$ → $x = -2$
- Solutions: $x = 8$ or $x = -2$

More complex:
- $|2x + 1| = 9$
- Case 1: $2x + 1 = 9$ → $x = 4$
- Case 2: $2x + 1 = -9$ → $x = -5$

**Special Cases:**
- If $|x| = 0$, then $x = 0$ (one solution)
- If $|x| = -3$, no solution (absolute value can't be negative)

### 7. Absolute Value Inequalities (900 words)

**Type 1: $|x| < a$ (Less Than)**

Meaning: Distance from zero is less than $a$

Solution: $-a < x < a$

Think: "Between negative $a$ and positive $a$"

Examples:
- $|x| < 5$ → $-5 < x < 5$
- $|x - 2| < 3$ → $-3 < x - 2 < 3$ → $-1 < x < 5$
- $|2x + 1| \leq 7$ → $-7 \leq 2x + 1 \leq 7$ → $-8 \leq 2x \leq 6$ → $-4 \leq x \leq 3$

Graph: Closed or open interval between two points

**Type 2: $|x| > a$ (Greater Than)**

Meaning: Distance from zero is greater than $a$

Solution: $x < -a$ OR $x > a$

Think: "Outside the range, either far left or far right"

Examples:
- $|x| > 4$ → $x < -4$ OR $x > 4$
- $|x + 1| > 2$ → $x + 1 < -2$ OR $x + 1 > 2$ → $x < -3$ OR $x > 1$
- $|3x - 2| \geq 5$ → $3x - 2 \leq -5$ OR $3x - 2 \geq 5$ → $x \leq -1$ OR $x \geq \frac{7}{3}$

Graph: Two rays going in opposite directions

**Summary Table:**

| Inequality | Solution Form | Verbal Description |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| $\|x\| < a$ | $-a < x < a$ | Between -a and a |
| $\|x\| \leq a$ | $-a \leq x \leq a$ | From -a to a, inclusive |
| $\|x\| > a$ | $x < -a$ or $x > a$ | Less than -a or greater than a |
| $\|x\| \geq a$ | $x \leq -a$ or $x \geq a$ | At most -a or at least a |
