## Methods and Procedures Covered

### Graphing Methods (3 approaches):

2. Using slope-intercept form (plot y-intercept, use slope)
3. Using table of values (calculate points, plot, connect)

### Writing Equations (4 scenarios):
1. Given slope and y-intercept → direct substitution
2. Given slope and a point → point-slope form
3. Given two points → calculate slope first
4. Given a graph → identify intercept, calculate slope
