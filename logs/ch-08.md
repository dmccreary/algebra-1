## LaTeX Equations Used

All equations properly formatted with single dollar signs as per specification:

- $f(x) = 2x + 3$
- $f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 2$
- $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$
- $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$
- $f(x) = |x|$
- Piecewise notation with cases environment
- Transformation forms: $g(x) = f(x-h) + k$
- Parent function forms

## Key Features

- **Pedagogical ordering:** Progressed from simple concepts (functions and relations) to complex (transformations)
- **Rich examples:** Multiple worked examples for each concept
- **Real-world connections:** Business, science, and everyday applications throughout
- **Visual variety:** Mix of diagrams, MicroSims, and infographics
- **Interactive emphasis:** 6 highly detailed MicroSims for student engagement
- **Tables for clarity:** Comparison tables and reference tables used appropriately
- **Reading level appropriate:** Senior High level with clear explanations and moderate complexity

## Detailed Specifications Created

Each `<details markdown="1">` block includes:
- Clear learning objective
- Complete visual layout specifications
- Interactive control descriptions
- Default parameters
- Detailed behavior descriptions
- Implementation notes with technology recommendations

These specifications are comprehensive enough for the microsim-p5 skill or a developer to implement without additional context.
