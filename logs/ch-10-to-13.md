2. Substitution: Solve one equation for a variable, substitute into other
3. Elimination: Add/subtract equations to eliminate a variable

**System Types**:
- Consistent + Independent: One solution (intersecting lines)
- Consistent + Dependent: Infinite solutions (same line)
- Inconsistent: No solution (parallel lines)

### Chapter 11: Quadratic Functions
**Core Forms**:
- Standard: $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$
