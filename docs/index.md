# Algebra I

![](img/cover.png){ width="600px" }

Welcome to our website for Algebra 1.  By building a [course dependency graph](sims/high-school-courses/main.html) you can see that Algebra 1 enables more courses in junior high and high school than any other class.  Algebra 1 opens more doors than any other class.  So it is essential that students do well in algebra.

But we don't want them to just do well.  We want students to love algebra! We think that a site full of engaging interactive charts, infographics and MicroSims is the best way for them to have fun and fall in love with algebra.

We think that intelligent textbooks are the future of education!  We would love your feedback.  We invite you to join a worldwide group of volunteers building free interactive intelligent textbooks for students around the world.  We believe that AI's greatest gift will be to democratize education for all.
