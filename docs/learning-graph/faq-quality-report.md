## Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution

Actual vs Target:

| Level | Actual | Target | Deviation | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Remember | 11 (15%) | 20% | -5% | ✓ Acceptable |
| Understand | 33 (44%) | 30% | +14% | ⚠ Slightly high |
| Apply | 13 (17%) | 25% | -8% | ✓ Acceptable |
| Analyze | 13 (17%) | 15% | +2% | ✓ Good |

**Overall Bloom's Score: 22/25** (good distribution, slight overemphasis on Understand level)

**Analysis:** The distribution is well-balanced across cognitive levels with a strong emphasis on understanding concepts. The higher percentage of "Understand" questions reflects the foundational nature of Algebra I. The absence of "Create" level questions is acceptable for an FAQ format, as FAQ typically focuses on explaining rather than asking students to create original work. Consider adding 2-3 Create-level questions about designing problems or synthesizing multiple concepts.
