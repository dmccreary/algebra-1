## Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution (Overall)

| Level | Actual Count | Actual % | Target % | Deviation | Status |
|-------|--------------|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Remember | 8 | 40% | 40% | 0% | ✓ Perfect |
| Understand | 7 | 35% | 40% | -5% | ✓ Acceptable |
| Apply | 5 | 25% | 15% | +10% | ⚠️ High |
| Analyze | 0 | 0% | 5% | -5% | ⚠️ Missing |
| Evaluate | 0 | 0% | 0% | 0% | ✓ Not expected |
| Create | 0 | 0% | 0% | 0% | ✓ Not expected |

**Bloom's Distribution Score:** 22/25

**Analysis:** The distribution is appropriate for introductory chapters. The higher Apply percentage shows good practical assessment. Future quizzes should include at least 1 Analyze-level question per chapter.

## Answer Balance (Overall)

| Option | Count | Percentage | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|------------|--------|--------|
| A | 1 | 5% | 25% | ⚠️ Severely underused |
| B | 11 | 55% | 25% | ⚠️ Overused |
| C | 7 | 35% | 25% | ⚠️ Slightly high |
| D | 1 | 5% | 25% | ⚠️ Severely underused |

**Answer Balance Score:** 12/15

**Critical Issue:** Options A and D are severely underused (5% each), while option B is overused (55%). This pattern could allow test-taking strategies rather than knowledge assessment.

**Recommendation:** Revise 4-5 questions to redistribute answers. Target: A=4-6, B=4-6, C=4-6, D=4-6 questions out of 20 total.
