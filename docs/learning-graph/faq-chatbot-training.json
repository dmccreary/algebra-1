Expressions represent values but don't make statements about equality or inequality—that's what equations and inequalities do. You can evaluate expressions by substituting values for variables, simplify them by combining like terms, or expand them using the distributive property.

      "answer": "An equation is a mathematical statement asserting that two expressions are equal, connected by an equals sign. For example, 2x + 5 = 13 states that the expression 2x + 5 equals 13. Equations can be conditional (true only for specific values like 2x = 10, true only when x = 5), identity (true for all values like 2(x + 3) = 2x + 6), or contradiction (never true like x + 5 = x + 3).

Compare: Expression: 3x + 5 (represents a value that depends on x). Equation: 3x + 5 = 14 (states that 3x + 5 equals 14). You simplify or evaluate expressions. You solve equations.

      "answer": "To solve an equation means to find all values of the variable that make the equation true. For example, solving 2x + 3 = 11 means finding what value of x makes the left side equal to the right side. The solution is x = 4 because 2(4) + 3 = 11 is a true statement. The solving process involves using inverse operations to isolate the variable, maintaining equality by doing the same operation to both sides, simplifying until the variable is alone, and checking your answer by substitution. Some equations have one solution, some have many, and some have none.",

      "answer": "A function is a relation where each input value corresponds to exactly one output value. Think of a function as a machine: you put a number in, the function processes it according to a rule, and exactly one number comes out. For example, the function f(x) = 2x + 1 takes any input x, doubles it, and adds 1. If you input 3, you get f(3) = 2(3) + 1 = 7. Functions can be represented as equations, tables showing input-output pairs, graphs as visual representations, or word descriptions.",

      "answer": "The order of operations is the standardized sequence for evaluating mathematical expressions: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division (left to right), Addition/Subtraction (left to right)—often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS. For example, to evaluate 3 + 4 × 2²: exponents first (2² = 4), giving 3 + 4 × 4; multiplication next (4 × 4 = 16), giving 3 + 16; addition last: 3 + 16 = 19.

      "question": "What is slope?",
      "answer": "Slope is a number representing the steepness and direction of a line, calculated as the ratio of vertical change (rise) to horizontal change (run) between two points. The slope formula is m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁). For example, a line through points (1, 2) and (3, 8) has slope m = (8-2)/(3-1) = 6/2 = 3. This means for every 1 unit you move right, the line rises 3 units. Slope tells you: positive slope (line rises left to right), negative slope (line falls left to right), zero slope (horizontal line), and undefined slope (vertical line).",

      "answer": "A coefficient is a numerical factor that multiplies a variable or variables in an algebraic term. In 5x², the coefficient is 5; in -3xy, the coefficient is -3. Coefficients tell you 'how many' of the variable you have. In the expression 4x² + 7x - 2, the coefficients are 4, 7, and -2 (the last one is the constant term).

Like terms can be combined by adding or subtracting their coefficients: 4x + 7x - 2x = 9x, and 3x² + 5x - 2x² + x = x² + 6x.

Examples include: x² - 5x + 6 = 0, 2x² + 3x - 2 = 0, and x² = 16. Quadratic equations can have two distinct real solutions (when b² - 4ac > 0), one repeated real solution (when b² - 4ac = 0), or two complex solutions (when b² - 4ac < 0).

Examples: x² - 9 = (x + 3)(x - 3), 4x² - 25 = (2x + 5)(2x - 5), and 49 - y² = (7 + y)(7 - y). Key features: two terms (binomial), minus sign between them, both terms are perfect squares, and factors into conjugate binomials (same terms, opposite signs). This pattern doesn't work for sums of squares: a² + b² doesn't factor over real numbers.

FOIL is actually just an application of the distributive property, but the acronym helps remember the process.

      "question": "How do I know when to use parentheses in expressions?",
      "answer": "Parentheses indicate the order of operations and grouping. Use them: (1) To override standard order of operations—without parentheses 3 + 4 × 2 = 11 (multiply first), with parentheses (3 + 4) × 2 = 14 (add first). (2) Around negative numbers in certain operations—subtracting a negative: 5 - (-3) = 8, multiplying: 4 × (-2) = -8, with exponents: (-2)² = 4 vs -2² = -4. (3) When distributing—3(x + 4) means multiply 3 by everything inside; without parentheses 3x + 4 only x is multiplied. (4) In function notation—f(x) = 2x + 1 or f(3). (5) For clarity—even when not required, parentheses can make expressions clearer. (6) With fractions in complex expressions—(x + 1)/(x - 1) for clarity. When in doubt: Add parentheses for clarity. Extra parentheses are rarely wrong; missing parentheses often cause errors.",

      "question": "What should I do when I am stuck on a problem?",
      "answer": "Getting stuck is normal—here's how to get unstuck. Immediate Strategies: (1) Reread the problem—make sure you understand what's being asked, identify given information, check if you missed something. (2) Review similar examples—look at worked examples in the textbook, find a similar problem you've solved. (3) Try a simpler version—use smaller numbers, remove complexity (example: if stuck on 14x + 23 = 107, try 2x + 3 = 7 first). (4) Work backwards—start from what you want and work toward what you have. (5) Check prerequisites—use the learning graph to identify concepts you should know first, review those concepts, return to the problem. (6) Take a break—sometimes stepping away helps your brain process, come back with fresh eyes. (7) Try a different method—stuck graphing? Try algebra. Stuck with substitution? Try elimination. (8) Ask for help—explain where you're stuck (not just 'I don't get it'), show what you've tried. What NOT to do: don't give up immediately, don't just copy an answer, don't skip entirely—try something. Struggle is part of learning.",

      "question": "How can I improve my speed without sacrificing accuracy?",
      "answer": "Speed comes from understanding and practice, not rushing. Build Understanding First—deeply understand concepts before trying to go fast, speed without understanding leads to errors, master one method thoroughly before learning shortcuts. Practice Deliberately—do many problems of the same type, gradually increase difficulty, time yourself but don't sacrifice accuracy. Recognize Patterns—with practice you'll recognize problem types faster, 'I've seen this before' speeds up method selection. Master Prerequisites—fast at arithmetic makes algebra faster, know multiplication tables cold, be comfortable with fractions, negatives, order of operations. Use Efficient Methods—learn when each method is fastest, use factoring when obvious; quadratic formula when not, recognize when to use shortcuts. Reduce Computation—simplify before substituting, cancel common factors early, look for clever approaches. Check as You Go—quick mental checks prevent having to redo entire problems ('Does this sign make sense?' 'Is this reasonable?'). What Slows You Down: errors requiring starting over, not knowing which method to use, weak prerequisite skills, inefficient methods. Focus on accuracy first. Speed follows naturally with practice and mastery.",

      "question": "Should I memorize formulas or learn to derive them?",
      "answer": "Both—but understanding comes first. Memorize: quadratic formula (x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/(2a)), slope formula (m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁)), distance formula if used frequently, and special products like (a+b)² = a² + 2ab + b². Why memorize: These are used repeatedly and deriving every time wastes time and increases error risk. Understand Derivations for: quadratic formula (from completing the square), slope-intercept form (from point-slope), and laws of exponents (from definitions). Why understand: If you forget the formula, you can recreate it. Understanding also shows you when and why to use each formula. Best Approach: Learn derivation first (builds understanding), use formula repeatedly (builds memory), check derivation occasionally (maintains understanding), if you forget during test, derive quickly. Memory Tips: practice using formulas regularly, create flashcards, explain formulas to others, understand what each part means. Don't rely purely on memory—understand the 'why' behind each formula. But also don't waste time deriving formulas you use daily.",

      "question": "What are complex numbers and why do we need them?",
      "answer": "Complex numbers extend the real number system to include solutions to equations like x² = -1, which have no real solutions. A complex number has the form a + bi, where a is the real part, b is the imaginary part, and i is the imaginary unit defined as i = √(-1) (so i² = -1). Examples: 3 + 4i, -2i, and 5 (all real numbers are complex numbers). Why we need them: (1) Complete the number system—just as negative numbers let us solve x + 5 = 2, complex numbers let us solve x² + 1 = 0. (2) Quadratic solutions—when discriminant b² - 4ac < 0, solutions are complex conjugates. (3) Engineering and physics—electrical engineering, quantum mechanics, and signal processing rely heavily on complex numbers. (4) Mathematical completeness—the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that every polynomial has complex roots. In Algebra I, you'll encounter complex numbers when quadratic equations have no real solutions.",

      "question": "How do exponential and linear functions compare?",
      "answer": "Linear and exponential functions have fundamentally different growth patterns. Linear Functions (f(x) = mx + b): change by constant amounts (additive), equal steps in x produce equal changes in y, graphed as straight lines, slope is constant (example: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 adds 2 each time). Exponential Functions (f(x) = a·b^x): change by constant factors (multiplicative), equal steps in x produce proportional changes in y, graphed as curves (increasing or decreasing rapidly), rate of change increases/decreases (example: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 multiplies by 2 each time). Key Difference: Linear adds the same amount repeatedly, exponential multiplies by the same factor repeatedly. In the real world: Linear (steady salary, constant speed travel), Exponential (compound interest, population growth, viral spread, radioactive decay). Long-term behavior: Exponential growth eventually outpaces any linear growth—this is why compound interest is so powerful over time.",

      "question": "What is correlation and does it imply causation?",
      "answer": "Correlation is a statistical relationship between two variables that indicates how they tend to change together, measured on a scale from -1 to 1. Positive correlation (0 to 1): as one variable increases, the other tends to increase (example: study time and test scores). Negative correlation (-1 to 0): as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease (example: car speed and travel time). No correlation (near 0): no predictable relationship (example: shoe size and test scores). Critical concept: Correlation does NOT imply causation. Just because two variables are correlated doesn't mean one causes the other. Possibilities: A causes B, B causes A, common cause (ice cream sales and drowning deaths are correlated—both increase in summer, but neither causes the other), or coincidence. To establish causation you need: controlled experiments, logical mechanism, elimination of confounding variables, and temporal precedence. In Algebra I, you'll learn to calculate correlation using scatterplots and lines of best fit, but remember: correlation ≠ causation.",
