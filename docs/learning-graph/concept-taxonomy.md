## Taxonomy Design Notes

- **Target Distribution:** ~16-17 concepts per category (200 ÷ 12 ≈ 16.7)
- **Maximum per Category:** <30% of total concepts (<60 concepts)
- **Color Coding:** Each category will receive a distinct color in the visualization
- **Pedagogical Progression:** Categories generally flow from foundational to advanced topics
- **Balanced Coverage:** No single category dominates the learning graph

## Category Abbreviation Guidelines

- All TaxonomyIDs are 3-5 uppercase letters
- IDs are intuitive and related to category name
- IDs are unique and used as keys in the learning graph JSON
