```text
Type: microsim

    Learning objective: Identify and classify algebraic expressions as monomials, binomials, trinomials, or non-polynomials

    Canvas layout (900x600px):
    - Top area (900x150): Expression display and question
    - Middle area (900x300): Classification buttons and workspace
    - Bottom area (900x150): Feedback and score

    Visual elements:
    - Large expression display (e.g., "$3x^2 + 5x - 7$")
    - Visual breakdown showing terms separated
    - Four classification buttons
    - Score and streak display
    - Timer (optional challenge mode)
    - Level indicator

    Game mechanics:
    - Show an algebraic expression
    - Student classifies it by clicking appropriate button
    - Immediate feedback with explanation
    - Progressive difficulty (starts simple, adds complexity)
    - Point system: +10 points per correct answer
    - Streak multiplier (×2 after 5 correct in a row)

    Classification buttons:
    1. "Monomial (1 term)"
    2. "Binomial (2 terms)"
    3. "Trinomial (3 terms)"
    4. "Not a polynomial"

    Expression types by level:

    Level 1 - Clear examples:
    - $5x$ → Monomial
    - $x + 3$ → Binomial
    - $x^2 + 2x + 1$ → Trinomial

    Level 2 - With coefficients and exponents:
    - $-3x^2$ → Monomial
    - $4x^3 - 7x$ → Binomial
    - $2a^2 + 5a - 3$ → Trinomial

    Level 3 - Tricky cases:
    - $\frac{1}{x} + 2$ → Not a polynomial (negative exponent)
    - $\sqrt{x} + 5$ → Not a polynomial (rational exponent)
    - $x^0$ → Monomial (equals 1)

    Level 4 - Multiple variables:
    - $3xy$ → Monomial
    - $x^2y + xy^2$ → Binomial
    - $a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ → Trinomial

    Interactive controls:
    - Four classification buttons
    - "Show terms" button (highlights each term)
    - "Hint" button (costs 3 points)
    - "Next expression" (after answering)
    - "Challenge mode" toggle (adds timer)

    Default parameters:
    - Level: 1
    - Score: 0
    - Challenge mode: off

    Behavior:
    - When "Show terms" clicked:
      - Visually separate terms with color coding
      - Count and display number of terms
      - Check for polynomial requirements (non-negative integer exponents)
    - When classification selected:
      - If correct: Green flash, explanation, award points
      - If incorrect: Red flash, show correct answer with why
    - Hint: "Count the terms. Check if all exponents are non-negative integers."

    Feedback examples:
    - Correct: "✓ Right! This has 2 terms, making it a binomial."
    - Incorrect: "✗ Not quite. $\frac{1}{x}$ is the same as $x^{-1}$ (negative exponent), so this is NOT a polynomial."
    - Term breakdown: "$3x^2 + 5x - 7$ has THREE terms: $3x^2$, $5x$, and $-7$"

    Visual features:
    - Term highlighting with different colors
    - Animated separation of terms
    - Exponent checking visualizer
    - Achievement badges (Perfect Classifier, Speed Demon)

    Implementation: p5.js with button interactions, expression parsing, animation effects, persistent scoring
