## About This MicroSim

This interactive Venn diagram illustrates the hierarchical relationships between different types of numbers in mathematics. Hover over each region to learn about that number system, see its mathematical symbol, and view examples.

## Number System Hierarchy

The diagram shows these number systems as concentric regions (innermost to outermost):

1. **Natural Numbers (ℕ)** - Counting numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
2. **Whole Numbers (W)** - Natural numbers plus zero: 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
3. **Integers (ℤ)** - Whole numbers and their negatives: ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...
4. **Rational Numbers (ℚ)** - Numbers expressible as fractions p/q
5. **Real Numbers (ℝ)** - All points on the number line

Plus two special sets:

- **Irrational Numbers (I)** - Real numbers that cannot be expressed as fractions (like π and √2)
- **Imaginary Numbers (𝕀)** - Multiples of i where i = √(-1)

All of these are contained within:

- **Complex Numbers (ℂ)** - Numbers of the form a + bi

## Key Relationships

- Every Natural Number is also a Whole Number, Integer, Rational, Real, and Complex
- Irrational Numbers are Real but NOT Rational
- Imaginary Numbers are Complex but NOT Real
- Real Numbers = Rational Numbers ∪ Irrational Numbers

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students will be able to:

1. Identify and define each type of number system
2. Explain the subset relationships between number systems
3. Classify given numbers into their appropriate number systems
4. Distinguish between rational and irrational numbers
5. Understand how complex numbers extend the real number system

### Activities

1. **Number Classification**: Give students a list of numbers and have them identify all the number systems each belongs to
2. **Venn Diagram Practice**: Have students draw their own Venn diagram from memory
3. **Example Generation**: Ask students to provide their own examples for each number type
4. **Real-World Connections**: Discuss where each number type appears in real life

### Discussion Questions

- Why do mathematicians need so many different types of numbers?
- Can you think of a number that is rational but not an integer?
- Why are irrational numbers called "irrational"?
- When might you encounter complex numbers in real life?
