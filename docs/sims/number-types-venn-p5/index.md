# Number Types Venn Diagram

## Description

This interactive Venn diagram visualizes the hierarchical relationships between different types of numbers in mathematics. It demonstrates how number sets are nested within each other, showing that:

- **Natural Numbers** (1, 2, 3, ...) are the counting numbers
- **Whole Numbers** include natural numbers plus zero (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
- **Integers** include whole numbers and their negatives (..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...)
- **Rational Numbers** can be expressed as a ratio of two integers (fractions, terminating or repeating decimals)
- **Irrational Numbers** cannot be expressed as fractions (π, √2, e)
- **Real Numbers** encompass all rational and irrational numbers

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:

1. Identify the hierarchical relationship between different number types
2. Understand that each inner set is a subset of the outer sets
3. Classify numbers into their appropriate categories
4. Recognize examples of each number type
5. Distinguish between rational and irrational numbers

## How to Use

- **Hover over any region** to see a tooltip explaining what that number type means
- **Toggle "Show Labels"** to show or hide the names of each number set
- **Toggle "Show Examples"** to show or hide example numbers in each region

## Key Concepts

**Subset Relationships:**

The diagram illustrates that:
- Natural ⊂ Whole ⊂ Integer ⊂ Rational ⊂ Real
- Every natural number is also a whole number, integer, rational number, and real number
- The symbol ⊂ means "is a subset of"

**Rational vs. Irrational:**

- Rational numbers can be written as fractions (a/b where b ≠ 0)
- Irrational numbers have non-repeating, non-terminating decimal expansions
- Together, rationals and irrationals make up all real numbers

## Assessment Questions

1. Is every integer also a rational number? Why or why not?
2. Give an example of a number that is whole but not natural.
3. Why is π (pi) classified as irrational?
4. What is the smallest set that contains the number -7?
5. Can a number be both rational and irrational? Explain.

## Extensions

- Research imaginary and complex numbers - where would they fit?
- Explore the cardinality (size) of these infinite sets
- Investigate transcendental numbers as a subset of irrationals
- Study the historical development of number systems
