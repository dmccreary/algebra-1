# Algebra I

**Course Title:** Algebra I  
**Target Audience:** Junior High or High School Students (Grades 8–10)  
**Prerequisites:** Successful completion of Pre-Algebra or equivalent foundational mathematics course, including proficiency in arithmetic operations, fractions, decimals, ratios, and basic geometry.

## Course Description

Algebra I is a foundational mathematics course designed to transition students from arithmetic reasoning to abstract algebraic thinking. This course introduces variables, functions, and relationships among quantities, emphasizing the ability to represent real-world situations using mathematical models. Students will develop fluency in manipulating algebraic expressions, solving equations and inequalities, analyzing patterns, and interpreting data.

Algebra I serves as the gateway to higher-level mathematics such as Geometry, Algebra II, Trigonometry, and Calculus. Students will explore both symbolic and graphical representations of relationships and will use technology and reasoning to analyze linear, quadratic, and exponential functions. The course encourages mathematical communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving, aligning with the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) recommendations.

## Intended Audience

This course is intended for students who are beginning formal study in algebra, typically in Grades 8 through 10.
