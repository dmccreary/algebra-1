# Introduction to Functions

## Summary

This chapter introduces one of the most important concepts in mathematics: functions. Students will learn to distinguish between relations and functions, understand function notation, and work with domain and range. The chapter explores how to evaluate functions, identify independent and dependent variables, and introduces various types of functions including continuous, discrete, piecewise, step, and absolute value functions. Students will also learn about parent functions and function transformations including translations and reflections.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 16 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Function
2. Domain
3. Range
4. Function Notation
5. Evaluating Functions
6. Vertical Line Test
7. Continuous Function
8. Piecewise Function
9. Step Function
10. Absolute Value Function
11. Parent Function
12. Function Transformation
13. Translation
14. Reflection
15. Linear Function
16. Quadratic Function
