#### 1. Which statement best defines a function?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A relationship where each output has exactly one input
2. A relationship where each input has exactly one output
3. Any set of ordered pairs
4. A relationship where some inputs can have multiple outputs
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A function is a special type of relation where each input value (x) corresponds to exactly one output value (y). This is the fundamental definition of a function. Option A reverses the relationship. Option C is too broad—it describes any relation, not specifically a function. Option D contradicts the definition of a function.

#### 2. For the function f(x) = 3x - 5, what is f(4)?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 12
2. -2
3. 17
4. 7
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. Substitute 4 for x: f(4) = 3(4) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. Function notation f(4) asks "what is the output when the input is 4?" Option A shows only 3×4 without subtracting 5. Option B uses -4 instead of 4. Option C adds instead of subtracts.

#### 3. Which set of ordered pairs represents a function?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. {(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 4), (3, 5)}
2. {(1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2)}
3. {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (2, 5)}
4. {(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)}
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. In this set, each input (1, 2, 3, 4) has exactly one output (all map to 2). This satisfies the definition of a function. Option A has input 1 mapping to both 2 and 4, violating the function rule. Option C has input 2 mapping to both 3 and 5. Option D has input 5 mapping to four different outputs. Multiple inputs can share the same output, but each input must have only one output.

#### 4. What is the domain of the function f(x) = √(x - 3)?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. All real numbers
2. x > 3
3. x < 3
4. x ≥ 3
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. The domain consists of all input values for which the function is defined. Since you cannot take the square root of a negative number (in the real number system), we need x - 3 ≥ 0, which means x ≥ 3. Option A ignores the restriction. Option B uses strict inequality when x = 3 is actually allowed. Option C reverses the inequality direction.

    **Concept Tested:** Domain

#### 5. Which graph fails the vertical line test and therefore is NOT a function?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A parabola opening upward
2. A circle
3. A straight line with positive slope
4. An exponential curve
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A circle fails the vertical line test because a vertical line can intersect a circle at two points, meaning one input (x-value) would correspond to two outputs (y-values). This violates the definition of a function. Options A, C, and D all pass the vertical line test—any vertical line intersects each of these graphs at most once.

    **Concept Tested:** Vertical Line Test

    **See:** [Vertical Line Test](index.md#the-vertical-line-test)

#### 6. If f(x) = x² and g(x) = x + 3, what is (f + g)(2)?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 9
2. 25
3. 5
4. 11
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Function addition works by adding the outputs: (f + g)(2) = f(2) + g(2). First, f(2) = 2² = 4. Then g(2) = 2 + 3 = 5. So (f + g)(2) = 4 + 5 = 9. Option B calculates (f ∘ g)(2) = f(g(2)) = f(5) = 25. Option C gives only g(2). Option D incorrectly adds the functions algebraically first.

#### 7. Which type of function shows a constant rate of change?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Quadratic function
2. Exponential function
3. Linear function
4. Absolute value function
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Linear functions have a constant rate of change (the slope m in y = mx + b). For every unit increase in x, y changes by the same amount. Quadratic functions have increasing/decreasing rates of change. Exponential functions have rates that change multiplicatively. Absolute value functions have different rates on each side of the vertex.

#### 8. What is the range of the function f(x) = x² for all real numbers x?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. All real numbers
2. x ≥ 0
3. y ≥ 0
4. y ≤ 0
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The range is the set of all possible output values. Since x² is always non-negative for any real number x, the output values are all y ≥ 0. The smallest value is 0 (when x = 0), and values can be arbitrarily large. Option A ignores that squares are non-negative. Option B confuses domain with range. Option D reverses the inequality.

    **Concept Tested:** Range

#### 9. Which represents the independent variable in a function?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The output value
2. The y-coordinate
3. The input value
4. The range
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The independent variable is the input to the function, typically represented by x. It's called "independent" because you can choose its value freely. The dependent variable (output/y-coordinate) depends on what input you choose. Option A describes the dependent variable. Option B is another name for the output. Option D is the set of all outputs.

    **Concept Tested:** Independent Variable / Dependent Variable

#### 10. A piecewise function is defined as f(x) = {x + 1 if x < 0; 2x if x ≥ 0}. What is f(-3) + f(3)?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 3
2. 4
3. 8
4. -2
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. For f(-3), since -3 < 0, we use the first rule: f(-3) = -3 + 1 = -2. For f(3), since 3 ≥ 0, we use the second rule: f(3) = 2(3) = 6. Therefore, f(-3) + f(3) = -2 + 6 = 4. Option A uses only f(3). Option C uses the wrong rule for f(-3). Option D gives only f(-3).
