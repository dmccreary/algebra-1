# Quiz: Foundations of Algebra

Test your understanding of the fundamental building blocks of algebra with these questions.

#### 1. What is a variable in algebra?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A number that never changes its value
2. A symbol (usually a letter) that represents an unknown or changing value
3. A mathematical operation like addition or subtraction
4. The answer to an equation
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A variable is a symbol (usually a letter) that represents an unknown or changing value. Variables are what make algebra powerful—they let us work with values we don't know yet or values that can change. Option A describes a constant, not a variable. Option C describes an operation, and option D describes a solution.

    **Concept Tested:** Variable

    **See:** [Variable](index.md#variables-the-power-of-the-unknown)

#### 2. What does PEMDAS stand for in the order of operations?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally - representing Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction
2. Problems Evaluate More Difficult After Solving
3. Powers, Equations, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Symbols
4. Parentheses, Expressions, Monomials, Division, Addition, Simplification
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. PEMDAS is a memory tool that stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right). The phrase "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" helps students remember this sequence. The other options are not standard mathematical acronyms and do not represent the correct order of operations.

    **Concept Tested:** Order of Operations

    **See:** [Order of Operations](index.md#order-of-operations-the-rules-of-the-game)

#### 3. In the expression $5x + 7$, what are the coefficients and constants?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Coefficient is 7, constant is 5
2. Coefficient is 5, constant is 7
3. Both 5 and 7 are coefficients
4. Both 5 and 7 are constants
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. In the expression $5x + 7$, the coefficient is 5 (the number that multiplies the variable $x$) and the constant is 7 (the number standing alone without a variable). A coefficient always multiplies a variable, while a constant is a value that doesn't change and has no variable attached to it.

    **Concept Tested:** Coefficient, Constant

    **See:** [Coefficients](index.md#coefficients-numbers-that-multiply-variables)

#### 4. Which of the following are like terms?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. $3x$ and $3y$
2. $5x^2$ and $5x$
3. $7y$ and $-2y$
4. $4ab$ and $4a$
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Like terms have exactly the same variable parts (same variables raised to the same powers), with only the coefficients being different. $7y$ and $-2y$ both have the variable $y$ raised to the first power, so they are like terms. Option A has different variables ($x$ vs $y$), option B has different exponents ($x^2$ vs $x$), and option D has different variable combinations ($ab$ vs $a$).

    **Concept Tested:** Like Terms

    **See:** [Like Terms](index.md#like-terms-terms-that-match)

---

#### 5. What is the difference between an expression and an equation?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Expressions contain variables, equations do not
2. Equations have an equals sign, expressions do not
3. Expressions can be solved, equations cannot
4. There is no difference between them
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. An equation is a mathematical statement that two expressions are equal, and it always contains an equals sign (=). An expression is a mathematical phrase that represents a value but does not make a statement about equality. For example, $3x + 5$ is an expression, while $3x + 5 = 17$ is an equation. Both can contain variables, but only equations make claims that can be verified or solved.

    **Concept Tested:** Expression, Equation

    **See:** [Equations](index.md#equations-making-mathematical-statements)

#### 6. Which statement correctly describes combining like terms in the expression $4x + 3 + 2x - 7$?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Combine all terms to get $12x$
2. Combine $x$ terms to get $6x$ and constants to get $-4$, resulting in $6x - 4$
3. Combine $x$ terms to get $6x$ and constants to get $10$, resulting in $6x + 10$
4. The expression cannot be simplified further
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. When combining like terms, we add the $x$ terms: $4x + 2x = 6x$, and we add the constant terms: $3 + (-7) = 3 - 7 = -4$. The simplified expression is $6x - 4$. We cannot combine the variable terms with the constant terms because they are not like terms. Option A incorrectly combines unlike terms, option C makes an arithmetic error with the constants, and option D is incorrect because the expression can be simplified.

    **Concept Tested:** Combining Like Terms

    **See:** [Combining Like Terms](index.md#combining-like-terms-simplifying-by-adding)

#### 7. Evaluate the expression $3x + 5$ when $x = 4$.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 12
2. 32
3. 17
4. 15
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. To evaluate the expression, we substitute $x = 4$ into the expression: $3(4) + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17$. First multiply $3 \times 4 = 12$, then add $5$ to get $17$. Option A represents only the multiplication step ($3 \times 4$), option B incorrectly multiplies $4 \times (3 + 5)$, and option D represents an arithmetic error.

    **Concept Tested:** Evaluating Expressions, Substitution

    **See:** [Evaluating Expressions](index.md#evaluating-expressions-finding-the-value)

---

#### 8. Using the distributive property, which expression is equivalent to $3(x + 4)$?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. $3x + 4$
2. $3x + 12$
3. $x + 12$
4. $3x + 7$
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The distributive property states that $a(b + c) = ab + ac$. Applying this to $3(x + 4)$, we multiply $3$ by each term inside the parentheses: $3 \times x = 3x$ and $3 \times 4 = 12$, giving us $3x + 12$. Option A fails to distribute the $3$ to the constant $4$, option C fails to multiply the variable term by $3$, and option D is completely incorrect.

    **Concept Tested:** Expanding Expressions, Distributive Property

    **See:** [Expanding Expressions](index.md#expanding-expressions-removing-parentheses)

---

#### 9. How many terms are in the expression $2x^2 - 5x + 3y - 8$?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 2 terms
2. 3 terms
3. 4 terms
4. 5 terms
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Terms are separated by plus (+) or minus (-) signs. In the expression $2x^2 - 5x + 3y - 8$, we have four terms: $2x^2$, $-5x$, $3y$, and $-8$. Each term can be a single number, variable, or product of numbers and variables. When counting terms, remember that the sign in front of each term is part of that term.

    **Concept Tested:** Term

    **See:** [Terms](index.md#terms-building-blocks-of-expressions)

#### 10. Which of the following is a monomial?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. $x + 5$
2. $7x^2y$
3. $2x - 3$
4. $a + b + c$
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A monomial is an algebraic expression with only one term. $7x^2y$ is a single term consisting of a coefficient ($7$) multiplied by variables ($x^2$ and $y$). Option A, C, and D all have multiple terms separated by plus or minus signs, making them binomials (two terms) or trinomials (three terms), not monomials.

    **Concept Tested:** Monomial

    **See:** [Monomials](index.md#monomials-single-term-expressions)
