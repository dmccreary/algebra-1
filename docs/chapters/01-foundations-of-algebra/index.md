## Introduction to Algebra

Algebra is the language of mathematics. Just as you learned to read and write English to communicate ideas, you'll learn to read and write algebraic expressions to communicate mathematical relationships. In this chapter, you'll discover the fundamental building blocks that make algebra work.

Think of algebra like learning a new language. First, you need to understand the alphabet and basic words before you can write sentences. In algebra, numbers, variables, and operations are like the alphabet. Once you understand these basics, you can build more complex expressions and solve real-world problems.

### What Makes Algebra Different?

Arithmetic uses specific numbers: "3 + 5 = 8". Algebra uses variables to represent unknown or changing values: "$x + 5 = 8$, what is $x$?" This simple difference opens up endless possibilities for solving problems and understanding patterns.

## Numbers: The Foundation

A **number** is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label quantities. You've worked with numbers your entire life, but let's review the types of numbers you'll encounter in algebra.

### Types of Numbers

The following table shows the main types of numbers used in Algebra I:

| Number Type | Description | Examples |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Natural Numbers | Counting numbers starting from 1 | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... |
| Whole Numbers | Natural numbers plus zero | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... |
| Integers | Whole numbers and their negatives | ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ... |
| Rational Numbers | Numbers that can be written as fractions | $\frac{1}{2}$, $-\frac{3}{4}$, 0.5, 2 |
| Irrational Numbers | Numbers that cannot be written as fractions | $\pi$, $\sqrt{2}$, $\sqrt{3}$ |

Understanding these number types helps you know what kind of solutions to expect when solving equations. For example, the equation $2x = 7$ has a rational solution ($x = \frac{7}{2}$ or $3.5$), while $x^2 = 2$ has an irrational solution ($x = \sqrt{2}$).

## Variables: The Power of the Unknown

A **variable** is a symbol (usually a letter) that represents an unknown or changing value. Variables are what make algebra powerful—they let us work with values we don't know yet or values that can change.

### Why Use Variables?

Imagine you're planning a party and need to buy pizza. Each pizza costs $12. If you know you're buying 3 pizzas, you can calculate: $12 \times 3 = 36$ dollars. But what if you don't know how many pizzas you need yet? You can write:

**Cost = $12 × number of pizzas**

Or using algebra: $C = 12n$

where:

- $C$ is the total cost
- $n$ is the number of pizzas

Now you have a formula that works for any number of pizzas! This is the power of variables.

### Common Variable Names

The following are common conventions for variable names:

- $x$, $y$, $z$ - commonly used for unknown values
- $a$, $b$, $c$ - often used for coefficients (numbers multiplying variables)
- $n$ - frequently used for counting numbers
- $t$ - often represents time
- $d$ - commonly represents distance
- $r$ - frequently used for rate or radius

You can use any letter as a variable, but these conventions help communicate meaning clearly.

## Constants: Values That Stay the Same

A **constant** is a value that doesn't change. In algebraic expressions, constants are usually numbers written by themselves.

### Examples of Constants

In everyday life and mathematics, you encounter many constants:

- The speed of light: approximately 299,792,458 meters per second
- Pi ($\pi$): approximately 3.14159... (the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter)
- The number of days in a week: 7
- The price of an item (at a specific time): $15

In the expression $3x + 7$, the numbers 3 and 7 are constants because they don't change, while $x$ is a variable because its value can vary.

### Mathematical Constants

Some constants appear so frequently in mathematics that they have special names:

| Constant | Symbol | Approximate Value | Meaning |
|----------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Pi | $\pi$ | 3.14159... | Ratio of circumference to diameter |
| Euler's number | $e$ | 2.71828... | Base of natural logarithms |
| Golden ratio | $\phi$ | 1.61803... | Special ratio found in nature |

## Coefficients: Numbers That Multiply Variables

A **coefficient** is a number that multiplies a variable. Coefficients tell us "how many" of a variable we have.

### Identifying Coefficients

Let's look at the expression $5x + 3y - 2$

- The coefficient of $x$ is 5 (we have 5 x's)
- The coefficient of $y$ is 3 (we have 3 y's)
- The number -2 is a constant (no variable)

### Special Coefficients

Sometimes coefficients are not written explicitly:

- When you see $x$ by itself, the coefficient is 1 (we write $x$ instead of $1x$)
- When you see $-x$, the coefficient is -1 (we write $-x$ instead of $-1x$)

Understanding coefficients helps you combine like terms and solve equations efficiently.

## Terms: Building Blocks of Expressions

A **term** is a single number, variable, or the product of numbers and variables. Terms are separated by plus (+) or minus (-) signs.

### Anatomy of a Term

Consider the term $-4x^2$

This term has three parts:

- Sign: negative (-)
- Coefficient: 4
- Variable part: $x^2$

### Counting Terms

How many terms are in each expression?

- $5x + 3$ has 2 terms
- $2x - 7y + 9$ has 3 terms
- $x^2 + 3x - 4x + 8$ has 4 terms
- $15$ has 1 term (called a monomial)

Understanding terms helps you organize expressions and perform operations correctly.

## Expressions: Putting It All Together

An **expression** is a mathematical phrase that can contain numbers, variables, operators, and grouping symbols. Unlike equations, expressions don't have an equals sign—they represent a value but don't make a statement about equality.

### Examples of Expressions

The following are valid algebraic expressions:

- $5$
- $x + 3$
- $2a - 7b + 9$
- $\frac{1}{2}x^2 + 3x - 4$
- $(2x + 1)(x - 3)$

### Parts of an Expression

Every expression contains:

- **Terms**: Parts separated by + or - signs
- **Coefficients**: Numbers multiplying variables
- **Variables**: Letters representing unknown values
- **Constants**: Numbers standing alone

Understanding the structure of expressions helps you manipulate them correctly and solve problems.

## Equations: Making Mathematical Statements

An **equation** is a mathematical statement that two expressions are equal. Equations always contain an equals sign (=).

### Equations vs. Expressions

The key difference:

- **Expression**: $3x + 5$ (represents a value)
- **Equation**: $3x + 5 = 17$ (states that two things are equal)

Equations make claims that you can verify or solve. When you solve an equation, you find the value(s) of the variable that make the equation true.

### Examples of Equations

Here are some equations you'll work with:

- $x + 7 = 12$ (simple linear equation)
- $2y - 3 = y + 5$ (equation with variables on both sides)
- $x^2 = 16$ (quadratic equation)
- $\frac{x}{4} + 2 = 9$ (equation with fractions)

Each equation is asking the question: "What value makes this statement true?"

## Inequalities: Greater Than and Less Than

An **inequality** is a mathematical statement that compares two expressions using inequality symbols instead of an equals sign.

### Inequality Symbols

The following symbols are used to write inequalities:

| Symbol | Meaning | Example | Read As |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| $<$ | Less than | $x < 5$ | "$x$ is less than 5" |
| $>$ | Greater than | $x > 3$ | "$x$ is greater than 3" |
| $\leq$ | Less than or equal to | $x \leq 10$ | "$x$ is less than or equal to 10" |
| $\geq$ | Greater than or equal to | $x \geq 0$ | "$x$ is greater than or equal to 0" |
| $\neq$ | Not equal to | $x \neq 7$ | "$x$ is not equal to 7" |

### Real-World Inequalities

Inequalities appear frequently in real situations:

- "You must be at least 13 years old to have a social media account": $\text{age} \geq 13$
- "The speed limit is 65 mph": $\text{speed} \leq 65$
- "The store needs more than 50 customers today to meet its goal": $\text{customers} > 50$

Unlike equations (which usually have one or a few specific solutions), inequalities typically have infinitely many solutions forming a range of values.

## Order of Operations: The Rules of the Game

The **Order of Operations** is a set of rules that tells us the correct sequence for performing calculations in expressions with multiple operations.

### PEMDAS: A Memory Tool

The acronym **PEMDAS** helps remember the order:

- **P**arentheses
- **E**xponents
- **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (left to right)
- **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (left to right)

Some people remember this as "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally."

### Why Order Matters

Consider the expression: $3 + 4 \times 2$

- **Wrong approach** (left to right): $3 + 4 = 7$, then $7 \times 2 = 14$
- **Correct approach** (PEMDAS): $4 \times 2 = 8$, then $3 + 8 = 11$

The order of operations ensures everyone gets the same answer!

### Examples of Order of Operations

Let's evaluate: $2 + 3^2 \times 4 - 5$

Following PEMDAS:

1. Exponents: $3^2 = 9$, giving us $2 + 9 \times 4 - 5$
2. Multiplication: $9 \times 4 = 36$, giving us $2 + 36 - 5$
3. Addition and Subtraction (left to right): $2 + 36 = 38$, then $38 - 5 = 33$

**Answer: 33**

## Evaluating Expressions: Finding the Value

**Evaluating an expression** means finding its numerical value by substituting specific numbers for variables and performing the calculations using the order of operations.

### The Evaluation Process

To evaluate an expression:

1. **Substitute** the given values for all variables
2. **Apply** the order of operations (PEMDAS)
3. **Simplify** step by step to find the final value

### Example: Evaluating an Expression

Evaluate $3x + 5$ when $x = 4$

**Step 1: Substitute**
$3(4) + 5$

**Step 2: Multiply**
$12 + 5$

**Step 3: Add**
$17$

**Answer: 17**

### Multiple Variables Example

Evaluate $2a - 3b + 7$ when $a = 5$ and $b = 2$

**Step 1: Substitute**
$2(5) - 3(2) + 7$

**Step 2: Multiply (left to right)**
$10 - 6 + 7$

**Step 3: Subtract and Add (left to right)**
$4 + 7 = 11$

**Answer: 11**

## Substitution: Replacing Variables with Values

**Substitution** is the process of replacing variables in an expression or equation with specific numerical values. You've already seen substitution in action when evaluating expressions.

### Why Substitution Matters

Substitution allows us to:

- Evaluate expressions for specific cases
- Check if a value is a solution to an equation
- Test formulas with real-world data
- Simplify complex expressions by replacing one variable at a time

### Using Substitution to Check Solutions

Is $x = 6$ a solution to the equation $2x - 3 = 9$?

**Substitute** $x = 6$:
$2(6) - 3 = 9$

**Evaluate left side**:
$12 - 3 = 9$

**Check**:
$9 = 9$ ✓ True!

Yes, $x = 6$ is a solution.

### Substitution with Formulas

The area of a triangle is given by the formula:

#### Area of a Triangle

$A = \frac{1}{2}bh$

where:

- $A$ is the area
- $b$ is the base
- $h$ is the height

Find the area when $b = 10$ and $h = 6$:

**Substitute**:
$A = \frac{1}{2}(10)(6)$

**Multiply**:
$A = \frac{1}{2}(60)$

**Simplify**:
$A = 30$

The area is 30 square units.

## Like Terms: Terms That Match

**Like terms** are terms that have exactly the same variable parts (same variables raised to the same powers). Only the coefficients can be different.

### Identifying Like Terms

Look at these examples:

**Like terms:**
- $3x$ and $7x$ (both have the variable $x$)
- $-5y^2$ and $2y^2$ (both have $y^2$)
- $4ab$ and $-ab$ (both have $ab$)

**NOT like terms:**
- $3x$ and $3x^2$ (different exponents)
- $5x$ and $5y$ (different variables)
- $2xy$ and $2x$ (different variable combinations)

### Why Like Terms Matter

You can only combine terms that are like terms. Think of it like fruit: you can add 3 apples + 5 apples = 8 apples, but you can't directly combine 3 apples + 5 oranges into a single number of one fruit.

## Combining Like Terms: Simplifying by Adding

**Combining like terms** means adding or subtracting the coefficients of like terms while keeping the variable part unchanged. This is one of the most important skills in algebra for simplifying expressions.

### How to Combine Like Terms

**Step 1**: Identify like terms
**Step 2**: Add or subtract their coefficients
**Step 3**: Keep the variable part the same

### Example: Combining Like Terms

Simplify: $5x + 3 + 2x - 7$

**Identify like terms**:
- $x$ terms: $5x$ and $2x$
- Constant terms: $3$ and $-7$

**Combine $x$ terms**:
$5x + 2x = 7x$

**Combine constants**:
$3 - 7 = -4$

**Final answer**:
$7x - 4$

### Multiple Variables Example

Simplify: $4x + 3y - 2x + 5y - 1$

**Group like terms**:
- $x$ terms: $4x - 2x = 2x$
- $y$ terms: $3y + 5y = 8y$
- Constants: $-1$

**Final answer**:
$2x + 8y - 1$

## Simplifying Expressions: Making Them Cleaner

**Simplifying an expression** means rewriting it in the simplest possible form by combining like terms, performing operations, and reducing complexity while keeping the same mathematical value.

### Why Simplify?

Simplified expressions are:

- Easier to read and understand
- Faster to evaluate
- Less prone to errors in later calculations
- Better for identifying patterns

### The Simplification Process

To simplify an expression:

1. Remove parentheses using the distributive property (if needed)
2. Combine like terms
3. Write terms in standard order (usually highest to lowest exponent)

### Example: Simplifying with Multiple Steps

Simplify: $3(x + 2) + 4x - 5$

**Step 1: Distribute**
$3x + 6 + 4x - 5$

**Step 2: Identify like terms**
- $x$ terms: $3x$ and $4x$
- Constants: $6$ and $-5$

**Step 3: Combine like terms**
- $3x + 4x = 7x$
- $6 - 5 = 1$

**Final simplified form**:
$7x + 1$

### Order Matters for Readability

Standard form typically lists:

- Terms from highest to lowest exponent
- Variables in alphabetical order
- Constant term last

For example, write $5 + 3x^2 - 2x$ as $3x^2 - 2x + 5$

## Expanding Expressions: Removing Parentheses

**Expanding an expression** means removing parentheses by applying the distributive property and multiplying terms. Expanding is the opposite of factoring.

### The Distributive Property

The distributive property states:

#### Distributive Property

$a(b + c) = ab + ac$

where:

- $a$ is the factor being distributed
- $b$ and $c$ are terms inside parentheses

This property allows us to multiply a number or variable by everything inside parentheses.

### Expanding Examples

**Example 1**: Expand $4(x + 3)$

$4(x + 3) = 4x + 12$

**Example 2**: Expand $-2(3y - 5)$

$-2(3y - 5) = -6y + 10$

(Note: $-2 \times (-5) = +10$)

**Example 3**: Expand $x(x + 7)$

$x(x + 7) = x^2 + 7x$

### When to Expand vs. Factor

- **Expand** when you need to combine like terms or simplify further
- **Factor** when you need to solve equations or identify common factors

Both skills are important and complement each other.

## Monomials: Single-Term Expressions

A **monomial** is an algebraic expression with only one term. Monomials are the simplest type of polynomial.

### Characteristics of Monomials

A monomial can be:

- A constant: $7$, $-3$, $\frac{1}{2}$
- A variable: $x$, $y$
- A product of constants and variables: $5x$, $-3y^2$, $2xy$, $4x^2y^3$

### What is NOT a Monomial

These are not monomials because they have more than one term:

- $x + 5$ (binomial - two terms)
- $2x - 3y + 7$ (trinomial - three terms)

### Identifying Monomials

The following table shows examples and non-examples:

| Expression | Monomial? | Reason |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| $8$ | Yes | Single constant |
| $x^3$ | Yes | Single variable with exponent |
| $-5xy$ | Yes | Single product of coefficient and variables |
| $3x + 2$ | No | Two terms separated by + |
| $\frac{4}{x}$ | No | Variable in denominator (not a polynomial) |
| $7x^2y^3$ | Yes | Single product with multiple variables |

Understanding monomials helps you recognize more complex polynomials and perform operations like multiplication and division.

## Prime Factorization: Breaking Numbers Apart

**Prime factorization** is the process of breaking a number down into its prime factors—the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number.

### What are Prime Numbers?

A **prime number** is a number greater than 1 that has exactly two factors: 1 and itself.

Prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ...

**Composite numbers** have more than two factors: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, ...

### Finding Prime Factorization

Use a factor tree to break down numbers systematically:

**Example**: Find the prime factorization of 24

```
        24
       /  \
      2    12
          /  \
         2    6
             / \
            2   3
```

Prime factorization of 24: $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 = 2^3 \times 3$

### Why Prime Factorization Matters in Algebra

Prime factorization helps you:

- Find greatest common factors (GCF)
- Simplify fractions
- Factor algebraic expressions
- Solve certain equations
