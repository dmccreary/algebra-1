# Systems of Equations and Inequalities

## Summary

This chapter teaches students how to work with multiple equations or inequalities simultaneously. Students will learn three methods for solving systems of linear equations: graphing, substitution, and elimination (linear combination). The chapter covers how to classify systems as consistent or inconsistent, and independent or dependent, understanding what these classifications mean graphically. Students will also learn to solve and graph systems of inequalities, identifying solution regions and boundary lines, and apply these techniques to real-world problems.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 14 concepts from the learning graph:

1. System of Equations
2. Solution of a System
3. Consistent System
4. Inconsistent System
5. Independent System
6. Dependent System
7. Graphing Method
8. Substitution Method
9. Elimination Method
10. Linear Combination
11. System of Inequalities
12. Graphing Systems
