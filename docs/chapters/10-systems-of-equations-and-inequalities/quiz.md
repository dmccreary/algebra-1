# Quiz: Systems of Equations and Inequalities

Test your understanding of solving systems of equations and inequalities using multiple methods with these questions.

#### 1. What is a solution to a system of two linear equations?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The y-intercept of both lines
2. The slope of both lines
3. An ordered pair that satisfies both equations
4. Any point on either line
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. A solution to a system of equations is an ordered pair (x, y) that makes both equations true simultaneously. Graphically, it's the point where the two lines intersect. Option A would only be a solution if both lines have the same y-intercept and are the same line. Option B describes parallel lines. Option D satisfies only one equation.

#### 2. A system of equations has no solution. What does this mean graphically?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The lines intersect at one point
2. The lines are the same line
3. The lines are parallel
4. The lines are perpendicular
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. When a system has no solution, it is called an inconsistent system. Graphically, this means the two lines are parallel—they have the same slope but different y-intercepts, so they never intersect. Option A describes one solution. Option B describes infinitely many solutions. Option D doesn't relate to number of solutions.

#### 3. Solve by substitution: y = 2x + 1 and 3x + y = 11. What is x?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. x = 1
2. x = 2
3. x = 3
4. x = 4
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Substitute y = 2x + 1 into the second equation: 3x + (2x + 1) = 11. Simplify: 5x + 1 = 11, so 5x = 10, giving x = 2. Then y = 2(2) + 1 = 5. The solution is (2, 5). Option A would give y = 3, which doesn't satisfy 3x + y = 11. Options C and D also don't satisfy both equations.

#### 4. Which method is best for solving this system: x + y = 10 and x - y = 4?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Graphing
2. Substitution
3. Elimination
4. All methods are equally efficient
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The elimination method is most efficient here because the y-coefficients are already opposites (+1 and -1). Adding the equations eliminates y immediately: 2x = 14, so x = 7. Then y = 3. While all methods work, elimination is fastest for this system. Substitution would require solving for a variable first. Graphing is less precise.

#### 5. What type of system has infinitely many solutions?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Inconsistent system
2. Independent system
3. Dependent system
4. Conditional system
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. A dependent system has infinitely many solutions because the two equations represent the same line. Every point on the line is a solution. Option A has no solution. Option B has exactly one solution. Option D is not a standard classification for systems.

    **Concept Tested:** Dependent System

#### 6. Solve using elimination: 2x + 3y = 12 and 4x - 3y = 6. What is the solution?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. (3, 2)
2. (2, 3)
3. (6, 0)
4. (0, 4)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Add the equations to eliminate y: (2x + 3y) + (4x - 3y) = 12 + 6, giving 6x = 18, so x = 3. Substitute into the first equation: 2(3) + 3y = 12, so 6 + 3y = 12, giving 3y = 6 and y = 2. The solution is (3, 2). You can verify: 4(3) - 3(2) = 12 - 6 = 6 ✓

#### 7. When graphing a system of inequalities, what represents the solution?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The boundary lines only
2. The region where shadings overlap
3. Any point on either boundary line
4. The area outside both inequalities
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The solution region for a system of inequalities is where the shaded regions of all inequalities overlap. Any point in this overlapping region satisfies all inequalities in the system. Option A represents only the boundaries, not the solution region. Option C may or may not be solutions depending on whether inequalities use ≤/≥ or </> symbols. Option D describes non-solutions.

#### 8. For the inequality y ≤ 2x + 1, should the boundary line be solid or dashed?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Solid, because of ≤
2. Dashed, because it's an inequality
3. Solid, because the slope is positive
4. Dashed, because of ≤
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. The ≤ symbol means "less than or equal to," so points on the line y = 2x + 1 are included in the solution. We use a solid line to show inclusion. A dashed line is used for < or > (strict inequalities) where the boundary is not included. The slope doesn't determine line style.

#### 9. A movie theater sells adult tickets for $12 and student tickets for $8. They sold 150 tickets for $1,520. Which system models this?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. a + s = 150; 12a + 8s = 1520
2. a + s = 1520; 12a + 8s = 150
3. 12a + 8s = 150; a + s = 1520
4. a - s = 150; 12a - 8s = 1520
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Let a = adult tickets and s = student tickets. The total number of tickets is a + s = 150. The total revenue is 12a + 8s = 1520 (adult tickets at $12 each plus student tickets at $8 each). Option B reverses the values. Option C also reverses them. Option D uses subtraction instead of addition.

#### 10. What happens when solving a dependent system algebraically?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. You get a false statement like 0 = 5
2. You get a true statement like 0 = 0
3. You get exactly one solution
4. You get two different solutions
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. When solving a dependent system (same line, infinitely many solutions), all variables cancel out and you're left with a true statement like 0 = 0 or 5 = 5. This indicates every point on the line is a solution. Option A describes an inconsistent system (no solution). Options C and D describe independent systems.
