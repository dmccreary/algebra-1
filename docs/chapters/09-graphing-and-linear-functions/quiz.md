# Quiz: Graphing and Linear Functions

Test your understanding of graphing linear functions, slope, intercepts, and linear equations with these questions.

#### 1. What does the slope of a line represent?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The y-intercept
2. The x-intercept
3. The rate of change or steepness
4. The starting point
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Slope measures the rate of change—how much y changes for each unit change in x. It represents the steepness and direction of a line. A positive slope rises left to right, while a negative slope falls. Option A describes where the line crosses the y-axis. Option B is where it crosses the x-axis. Option D is vague and doesn't capture the concept.

#### 2. Find the slope of the line passing through points (2, 3) and (6, 11).

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 2
2. 4
3. 1/2
4. 8
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Using the slope formula m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁): m = (11 - 3)/(6 - 2) = 8/4 = 2. This means for every 1 unit increase in x, y increases by 2 units. Option B calculates only the change in x. Option C inverts the fraction. Option D gives only the numerator.

#### 3. What is the slope of a horizontal line?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 1
2. 0
3. Undefined
4. -1
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A horizontal line has zero slope because there is no vertical change (rise = 0) as you move along the line. The equation is y = c for some constant c. Option C describes a vertical line. Options A and D would represent diagonal lines.

#### 4. In the equation y = -3x + 7, what is the y-intercept?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. -3
2. 3
3. 7
4. (0, 7)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C** (or **D** if asking for the point). In slope-intercept form y = mx + b, the b value is the y-intercept, which is 7. This is where the line crosses the y-axis. As a point, it's (0, 7). Option A gives the slope. Option B is the absolute value of the slope.

#### 5. Which form of a linear equation is Ax + By = C?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Slope-intercept form
2. Point-slope form
3. Standard form
4. Vertex form
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Standard form of a linear equation is Ax + By = C, where A, B, and C are integers and A is typically non-negative. Option A is y = mx + b. Option B is y - y₁ = m(x - x₁). Option D is for quadratic equations, not linear.

    **Concept Tested:** Standard Form

    **See:** [Standard Form](index.md#standard-form-ax--by--c)

#### 6. What are parallel lines characterized by?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Equal y-intercepts
2. Equal slopes
3. Perpendicular intersection
4. Opposite reciprocal slopes
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Parallel lines have equal slopes but different y-intercepts. They never intersect because they rise and run at the same rate. Option A alone doesn't guarantee parallel lines (they could be the same line). Option C describes perpendicular lines. Option D also describes perpendicular lines.

    **Concept Tested:** Parallel Lines

    **See:** [Parallel and Perpendicular Lines](index.md#parallel-and-perpendicular-lines)

#### 7. If a line has slope 2/3, what is the slope of a line perpendicular to it?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 2/3
2. -2/3
3. 3/2
4. -3/2
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. Perpendicular lines have slopes that are opposite reciprocals. The reciprocal of 2/3 is 3/2, and the opposite (negative) of that is -3/2. When you multiply the slopes of perpendicular lines, you get -1: (2/3) × (-3/2) = -1. Option A is for parallel lines. Option B is just the opposite. Option C is just the reciprocal.

    **Concept Tested:** Perpendicular Lines

    **See:** [Parallel and Perpendicular Lines](index.md#parallel-and-perpendicular-lines)

#### 8. Write the equation of a line with slope 4 passing through point (1, 5).

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. y = 4x + 1
2. y - 5 = 4(x - 1)
3. y = 4x + 5
4. y - 1 = 4(x - 5)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Using point-slope form y - y₁ = m(x - x₁) with m = 4 and point (1, 5): y - 5 = 4(x - 1). This can be simplified to slope-intercept form: y = 4x + 1. So option A is also correct after simplification. Option C uses the wrong y-intercept. Option D reverses the coordinates.

#### 9. What is the x-intercept of the line 2x - 3y = 12?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. (6, 0)
2. (0, -4)
3. (4, 0)
4. (0, 6)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. To find the x-intercept, set y = 0: 2x - 3(0) = 12, so 2x = 12, giving x = 6. The x-intercept is the point (6, 0). Option B is the y-intercept. Options C and D have incorrect calculations.

    **Concept Tested:** X-Intercept / Intercepts

    **See:** [Finding Intercepts](index.md#finding-intercepts)

#### 10. A linear function models the cost C of renting a car for d days: C = 45d + 25. What does the 25 represent?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The daily rental rate
2. The total cost for one day
3. The initial fee (y-intercept)
4. The number of days
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. In the equation C = 45d + 25, the constant term 25 is the y-intercept, representing the initial fee or base cost before any days are counted. The 45 is the slope (daily rate). Option A describes the slope. Option B would be 45(1) + 25 = 70. Option D is the variable d.
