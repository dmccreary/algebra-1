# Graphing and Linear Functions

## Summary

This chapter provides comprehensive coverage of the coordinate plane and linear functions. Students will learn to plot points, identify coordinates, and understand the structure of the coordinate plane including quadrants and the origin. The chapter extensively covers slope and rate of change, teaching students to calculate and interpret slope in multiple ways. Students will master three forms of linear equations (slope-intercept, point-slope, and standard form), learn to graph lines using various methods, and work with special cases including horizontal and vertical lines.
