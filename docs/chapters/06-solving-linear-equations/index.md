# Solving Linear Equations

## Summary

This chapter provides comprehensive instruction on solving linear equations in one variable. Students will progress from simple one-step equations to complex multi-step equations, learning systematic approaches to isolate variables and find solutions. The chapter covers equations with variables on both sides, equations involving fractions and decimals, and literal equations where students solve for a specified variable. Students will also learn to identify different types of solutions (conditional, identity, contradiction) and apply equation-solving skills to real-world application problems.
