#### 1. What is the first step in solving the equation 3x + 7 = 22?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Divide both sides by 3
2. Multiply both sides by 3
3. Subtract 7 from both sides
4. Add 7 to both sides
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. When solving a two-step equation like 3x + 7 = 22, the standard strategy is to first eliminate the constant term by subtracting 7 from both sides, giving 3x = 15. Then you can divide by 3 to isolate x. Option A skips the first step and would result in x + 7/3 = 22/3. Options B and D would move in the wrong direction.

#### 2. Which operation must you perform to solve x/4 = -6?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Divide both sides by 4
2. Add 4 to both sides
3. Subtract 4 from both sides
4. Multiply both sides by 4
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. To solve x/4 = -6, you need to eliminate the division by 4. The inverse operation of division is multiplication, so multiply both sides by 4 to get x = -24. Option A would result in x/16 = -3/2. Options B and C don't address the division operation.

#### 3. When solving -5x + 3 = 18, what is the value of x?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. x = 4
2. x = -4
3. x = -3
4. x = 3
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. First, subtract 3 from both sides: -5x = 15. Then divide both sides by -5: x = -3. Option A results from forgetting the negative sign on the coefficient. Option B comes from dividing incorrectly. You can verify: -5(-3) + 3 = 15 + 3 = 18 ✓

#### 4. What type of solution does the equation 2(x + 3) = 2x + 6 have?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. No solution (contradiction)
2. One solution: x = 0
3. One solution: x = 3
4. Infinitely many solutions (identity)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. Distributing gives 2x + 6 = 2x + 6. Subtracting 2x from both sides results in 6 = 6, which is always true. This is an identity equation, meaning every real number is a solution. Option A would result from a false statement like 0 = 5. Options B and C incorrectly assume a single solution exists.

#### 5. To solve the equation with fractions x/3 + x/4 = 7, what is the best first step?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Add the fractions on the left side
2. Multiply both sides by 12 (the LCD)
3. Divide both sides by 7
4. Multiply both sides by 3
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The most efficient method is to multiply every term by the least common denominator (LCD) of 3 and 4, which is 12. This clears all fractions: 12·(x/3) + 12·(x/4) = 12·7, giving 4x + 3x = 84, so 7x = 84 and x = 12. Option A works but is more complicated. Options C and D don't eliminate the fractions.

#### 6. Solve for w in the perimeter formula P = 2l + 2w. Which is correct?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. w = (P - 2l)/2
2. w = P - 2l
3. w = 2(P - l)
4. w = (P + 2l)/2
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. To solve for w, first subtract 2l from both sides: P - 2l = 2w. Then divide by 2: w = (P - 2l)/2. This is formula manipulation, a key skill for literal equations. Option B forgets to divide by 2. Option C incorrectly distributes. Option D uses addition instead of subtraction.

#### 7. When solving 5x - 7 = 2x + 8, what should you do after collecting variable terms on one side?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Divide by the coefficient
2. Subtract the constant from both sides
3. Add the constant to both sides
4. Multiply by the reciprocal
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. After subtracting 2x from both sides, you get 3x - 7 = 8. The next step is to add 7 to both sides to isolate the variable term: 3x = 15. Then you divide by 3 to get x = 5. Option A skips collecting constants. Option B would give 3x = 1. While option D can work, it's the same as dividing and not the typical next step after collecting variables.

#### 8. What happens when you solve x + 5 = x - 2?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. You get x = -7
2. You get x = 3
3. You get 5 = -2, which is false (no solution)
4. You get 0 = 0, which is true (infinite solutions)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Subtracting x from both sides gives 5 = -2, which is a false statement. This means the equation is a contradiction with no solution. The original equation shows a number that is 5 more than x equals a number that is 2 less than x, which is impossible. Option D would indicate an identity. Options A and B incorrectly assume a solution exists.

#### 9. To solve 0.5x + 1.2 = 3.7, what power of 10 should you multiply by to clear decimals?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 1 (no multiplication needed)
2. 10
3. 100
4. 1000
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The decimal with the most places is 0.5, 1.2, and 3.7, all with one decimal place. Multiplying by 10 converts these to whole numbers: 10(0.5x) + 10(1.2) = 10(3.7) gives 5x + 12 = 37, then 5x = 25, so x = 5. Option C or D would work but creates unnecessarily large numbers. Option A leaves the decimals.

#### 10. The sum of three consecutive integers is 72. If n represents the first integer, which equation models this situation?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. n + 2n + 3n = 72
2. n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) = 72
3. n + (n + 2) + (n + 4) = 72
4. 3n = 72
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Consecutive integers differ by 1, so if n is the first, then n + 1 is the second, and n + 2 is the third. Their sum is n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) = 72. Solving gives 3n + 3 = 72, so 3n = 69, and n = 23. The integers are 23, 24, and 25. Option A uses multiples instead of consecutive integers. Option C describes consecutive even integers. Option D omits the +1 and +2.
