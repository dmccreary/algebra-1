#### 1. What is a scatterplot used for?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Displaying one variable over time
2. Showing the relationship between two variables
3. Calculating the mean of a dataset
4. Finding the equation of a line
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A scatterplot displays paired data as points on a coordinate plane, showing how two variables are related. Each point represents one data pair (x, y), allowing you to visualize patterns, trends, and correlations. Option A describes a time series graph. Option C is a calculation, not a visualization. Option D is done using the data, not the scatterplot itself.

#### 2. What does positive correlation mean?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. As one variable increases, the other decreases
2. As one variable increases, the other also increases
3. The variables are unrelated
4. The relationship forms a circle
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Positive correlation occurs when both variables tend to increase together. On a scatterplot, the points form a pattern rising from left to right. Option A describes negative correlation. Option C describes no correlation. Option D doesn't describe a correlation pattern.

    **Concept Tested:** Positive Correlation / Correlation

#### 3. In a linear regression equation ŷ = 5x + 20, what does the 5 represent?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The y-intercept
2. The slope
3. The correlation coefficient
4. The initial value only
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. In the regression equation ŷ = mx + b, the coefficient of x (here, 5) is the slope. It represents the rate of change—for every 1-unit increase in x, y increases by 5 units. Option A is the constant term (20). Option C is represented by r, not part of the equation itself. Option D confuses slope with initial value.

#### 4. What is the explicit formula for an arithmetic sequence?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. a_n = a₁ · r^(n-1)
2. a_n = a₁ + (n-1)d
3. a_n = a₁ + nd
4. a_n = a₁ · d^n
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The explicit formula for an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a₁ + (n-1)d, where a₁ is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the term number. Option A is the geometric sequence formula. Option C forgets the -1. Option D incorrectly uses multiplication with an exponent.

    **Concept Tested:** Arithmetic Sequence

#### 5. Find the 10th term of the geometric sequence 3, 6, 12, 24, ...

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 768
2. 1,536
3. 384
4. 3,072
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The first term is a₁ = 3 and the common ratio is r = 2. Using a_n = a₁ · r^(n-1): a₁₀ = 3 · 2⁹ = 3 · 512 = 1,536. Option A uses 2⁸ instead of 2⁹. Option C uses 2⁷. Option D uses 2¹⁰.

#### 6. Which correlation coefficient indicates the strongest relationship?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. r = 0.3
2. r = -0.95
3. r = 0.5
4. r = 0
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The correlation coefficient r ranges from -1 to 1. The strength is determined by the absolute value |r|. Since |-0.95| = 0.95 is closest to 1, it indicates the strongest relationship (even though it's negative correlation). Option A is weak. Option C is moderate. Option D indicates no linear relationship.

#### 7. Savings grow from $1,000 to $1,500 in 10 years with compound interest at 4% annually. Which formula applies?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 1500 = 1000(1.04)^10
2. 1500 = 1000 + 1000(0.04)(10)
3. 1500 = 1000(1.4)^10
4. 1500 = 1000(0.96)^10
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Compound interest uses A = P(1 + r)^t, so 1500 = 1000(1.04)^10. The formula compounds the 4% growth each year. Option B is simple interest, not compound. Option C uses the wrong growth factor. Option D uses a decay factor instead of growth.

    **Concept Tested:** Compound Interest

    **See:** [Compound Interest](index.md#compound-interest)

#### 8. What does the line of best fit represent?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The exact relationship between all data points
2. The average of all y-values
3. A model that approximates the trend in the data
4. The median value
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The line of best fit is a linear model that best represents the overall trend or pattern in a scatterplot. It minimizes the distances from the points to the line, providing a useful approximation for making predictions. Option A is impossible—data points rarely all lie on one line. Options B and D describe statistical measures, not trend lines.

    **Concept Tested:** Line of Best Fit

    **See:** [Line of Best Fit](index.md#line-of-best-fit)

#### 9. In the sequence 5, 10, 15, 20, ..., what is the common difference?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 2
2. 5
3. 10
4. 15
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The common difference d is found by subtracting consecutive terms: 10 - 5 = 5, 15 - 10 = 5, 20 - 15 = 5. This arithmetic sequence adds 5 each time. Option A is incorrect. Options C and D give term values, not the difference.

    **Concept Tested:** Arithmetic Sequence / Common Difference

    **See:** [Structure of Arithmetic Sequences](index.md#structure-of-arithmetic-sequences)

#### 10. Which statement best describes negative correlation?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Both variables increase together
2. As one variable increases, the other decreases
3. Variables show no pattern
4. Data points form a horizontal line
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. On a scatterplot, points form a pattern falling from left to right (negative slope). Option A describes positive correlation. Option C describes no correlation. Option D doesn't represent a typical correlation pattern.
