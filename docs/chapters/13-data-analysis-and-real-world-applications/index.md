# Data Analysis and Real-World Applications

## Summary

This final chapter synthesizes algebraic concepts by applying them to data analysis and real-world problems. Students will learn to create and interpret scatterplots, analyze correlation patterns, and determine lines of best fit using linear regression. The chapter covers arithmetic and geometric sequences, connecting these patterns to linear and exponential functions studied earlier. Students will also work with compound interest problems and various application scenarios, developing their ability to model real-world situations mathematically and interpret results in context.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 12 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Data Set
2. Scatterplot
3. Correlation
4. Positive Correlation
5. Negative Correlation
6. No Correlation
7. Line of Best Fit
8. Linear Regression
9. Arithmetic Sequence
10. Geometric Sequence
11. Compound Interest
12. Exponential Function (applications)
