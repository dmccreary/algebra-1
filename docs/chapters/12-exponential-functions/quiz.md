#### 1. What is the general form of an exponential function?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. f(x) = mx + b
2. f(x) = ax² + bx + c
3. f(x) = a · b^x
4. f(x) = a/x
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. An exponential function has the form f(x) = a · b^x, where a is the initial value and b is the base. The variable appears in the exponent, which distinguishes it from other function types. Option A is linear. Option B is quadratic. Option D is a reciprocal/rational function.

#### 2. Which value of b indicates exponential decay in f(x) = a · b^x?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. b > 1
2. 0 < b < 1
3. b < 0
4. b = 1
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Exponential decay occurs when 0 < b < 1. The function decreases as x increases, approaching zero but never reaching it. Option A represents growth. Option C would create undefined values for non-integer exponents. Option D creates a constant function (f(x) = a).

#### 3. A population of 500 bacteria doubles every hour. What is the population after 3 hours?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 1,500
2. 2,000
3. 4,000
4. 8,000
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The function is P(t) = 500 · 2^t. After 3 hours: P(3) = 500 · 2³ = 500 · 8 = 4,000 bacteria. Option A adds instead of multiplying. Option B represents only one doubling. Option D forgets to multiply by the initial 500.

#### 4. If a quantity decreases by 15% each year, what is the decay factor?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 0.15
2. 0.85
3. 1.15
4. 15
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The decay factor is b = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85. Each year, 85% of the quantity remains (100% - 15% = 85%). Option A represents only the decrease rate, not what remains. Option C would be a growth factor. Option D is the percentage, not the decimal factor.

#### 5. What is the formula for compound interest?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A = P(1 + r)^t
2. A = P + rt
3. A = Prt
4. A = P(1 - r)^t
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. The compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r)^t, where A is the final amount, P is the principal, r is the annual rate (as a decimal), and t is time in years. Option B is simple interest. Option C is the interest earned formula. Option D represents decay, not growth.

#### 6. In the function f(x) = 100(1.05)^x, what does 100 represent?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The growth rate
2. The growth factor
3. The initial value
4. The final value
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. In f(x) = a · b^x, the coefficient a = 100 is the initial value (when x = 0). The growth factor is b = 1.05. Option A would be 5% or 0.05. Option B is 1.05. Option D depends on the value of x.

#### 7. How do you identify whether data represents exponential growth or linear growth?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Check if differences between consecutive terms are constant (linear) or ratios are constant (exponential)
2. Check if the graph is a straight line (exponential) or curved (linear)
3. Linear growth is always faster than exponential
4. Exponential growth uses addition; linear uses multiplication
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Linear functions have constant differences between consecutive y-values (same amount added each time). Exponential functions have constant ratios between consecutive y-values (same factor multiplied each time). Option B reverses the graph types. Option C is false—exponential eventually surpasses linear. Option D reverses the operations.

#### 8. You invest $2,000 at 6% interest compounded annually. What is the balance after 5 years?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. $2,600
2. $2,676
3. $2,300
4. $3,000
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Using A = P(1 + r)^t: A = 2000(1.06)^5 = 2000(1.3382) ≈ $2,676.45. Option A uses simple interest (2000 + 2000·0.06·5 = 2600). Option C has calculation errors. Option D significantly overestimates.

#### 9. What is the key characteristic of an exponential function's graph?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. It's a straight line
2. It has a horizontal asymptote
3. It crosses the x-axis
4. It has a vertex
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Exponential functions have a horizontal asymptote (usually the x-axis, y = 0) that the curve approaches but never reaches. Option A describes linear functions. Option C is false—exponential functions with positive a never cross the x-axis. Option D describes parabolas.

#### 10. A car worth $25,000 depreciates by 20% per year. What is its value after 3 years?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. $10,000
2. $12,800
3. $15,000
4. $20,000
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The decay factor is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80. Using V(t) = 25000(0.80)^t: V(3) = 25000(0.80)³ = 25000(0.512) = $12,800. Option A subtracts 20% three times incorrectly. Option C uses simple depreciation. Option D represents only one year of depreciation.
