# Exponential Functions

## Summary

This chapter introduces exponential functions and their applications to real-world growth and decay phenomena. Students will learn to distinguish between exponential growth and decay, understand growth and decay factors, and recognize the role of initial value in exponential models. The chapter includes practical applications such as compound interest and teaches students to compare linear and exponential functions, understanding when each model is appropriate. Students will also learn to graph exponential functions and identify their key characteristics.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 10 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Exponential Function
