# Linear Inequalities and Absolute Value

## Summary

This chapter extends equation-solving techniques to inequalities and absolute value situations. Students will learn to solve and graph linear inequalities, understanding how solution sets differ from equations and how to represent solutions on a number line. The chapter covers compound inequalities using "and" and "or" logic, and introduces absolute value equations and inequalities, helping students understand the geometric meaning of absolute value and solve more complex algebraic problems.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 10 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Inequality Symbols
2. Linear Inequality
3. Solving Linear Inequalities
4. Compound Inequalities
5. And Inequalities
6. Or Inequalities
