# Polynomial Expressions

## Summary

This chapter focuses on polynomial expressions and the operations used to manipulate them. Students will learn to classify polynomials by degree and number of terms, and develop fluency in adding, subtracting, and multiplying polynomials using the distributive property. The chapter introduces important techniques like the FOIL method for binomial multiplication and explores special products including the difference of squares and perfect square trinomials, which will prove essential for factoring in the next chapter.
