#### 1. What is the graph of a quadratic function called?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A line
2. A parabola
3. A hyperbola
4. A circle
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The graph of any quadratic function f(x) = ax² + bx + c is a U-shaped curve called a parabola. It opens upward if a > 0 or downward if a < 0. Option A describes linear functions. Options C and D are different conic sections.

#### 2. In the quadratic function f(x) = x² - 6x + 5, what is the axis of symmetry?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. x = -6
2. x = 6
3. x = 3
4. x = -3
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The axis of symmetry is found using x = -b/(2a). Here, a = 1 and b = -6, so x = -(-6)/(2·1) = 6/2 = 3. This vertical line passes through the vertex and divides the parabola into two mirror images. Option A uses b directly. Option B forgets to divide by 2. Option D uses the wrong sign.

#### 3. What does the discriminant b² - 4ac tell you about a quadratic equation?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The y-intercept
2. The vertex location
3. The nature and number of roots
4. The axis of symmetry
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The discriminant Δ = b² - 4ac determines the nature of roots: if Δ > 0, there are two distinct real roots; if Δ = 0, one real root (repeated); if Δ < 0, no real roots (two complex roots). Options A, B, and D describe other features found using different formulas.

#### 4. Solve x² - 9 = 0 using the square root method.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. x = 9
2. x = ±3
3. x = 3 only
4. x = ±9
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Rearrange to x² = 9, then take the square root of both sides: x = ±√9 = ±3. Both x = 3 and x = -3 are solutions. Option A forgets the ± symbol. Option C gives only the positive root. Option D doesn't take the square root.

#### 5. What is the vertex form of a quadratic function?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. f(x) = ax² + bx + c
2. f(x) = a(x - h)² + k
3. f(x) = a(x - r₁)(x - r₂)
4. y = mx + b
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Vertex form is f(x) = a(x - h)² + k, where (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola. This form makes the vertex immediately visible. Option A is standard form. Option C is factored form (when roots exist). Option D is linear, not quadratic.

    **Concept Tested:** Vertex Form

    **See:** [Vertex Form](index.md#vertex-form)

#### 6. Use the quadratic formula to solve x² + 5x + 3 = 0. What is the correct setup?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. x = (-5 ± √(25 - 12))/2
2. x = (5 ± √(25 + 12))/2
3. x = (-5 ± √(25 + 12))/2
4. x = (-5 ± √(5 - 12))/2
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. The quadratic formula is x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/(2a). Here, a = 1, b = 5, c = 3, so x = (-5 ± √(25 - 12))/2 = (-5 ± √13)/2. Option B uses +b instead of -b. Option C uses 4ac = +12 instead of -12 in the discriminant. Option D uses b instead of b².

#### 7. A ball is thrown upward with height h(t) = -16t² + 48t + 5. When does it hit the ground?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. When h(t) = 0
2. When t = 0
3. When h(t) = 5
4. When t = 48
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. The ball hits the ground when its height is zero, so set h(t) = 0 and solve for t. This gives -16t² + 48t + 5 = 0. Using the quadratic formula yields t ≈ 3.1 seconds (the positive solution). Option B gives the initial time. Option C is the initial height. Option D misinterprets the coefficient.

#### 8. What does the imaginary unit i represent?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. √1
2. √(-1)
3. The x-intercept
4. Infinity
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The imaginary unit i is defined as i = √(-1), which means i² = -1. Complex numbers use i to express square roots of negative numbers. For example, √(-4) = 2i. Option A equals 1, not i. Options C and D are unrelated concepts.

#### 9. Solve by factoring: x² + 7x + 12 = 0.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. x = -3 or x = -4
2. x = 3 or x = 4
3. x = -3 or x = 4
4. x = 3 or x = -4
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Factor: (x + 3)(x + 4) = 0. By the zero product property, x + 3 = 0 or x + 4 = 0, giving x = -3 or x = -4. You can verify: (-3)² + 7(-3) + 12 = 9 - 21 + 12 = 0 ✓. Option B has the wrong signs. Options C and D mix correct and incorrect values.

#### 10. If a quadratic function has vertex (2, -5) and opens upward, what is the minimum value?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 2
2. -5
3. -2
4. 5
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. For a parabola that opens upward, the vertex represents the minimum point. The minimum value is the y-coordinate of the vertex, which is -5. Option A gives the x-coordinate. Options C and D are incorrect transformations of the values.
