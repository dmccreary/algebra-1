# Quadratic Functions and Equations

## Summary

This chapter introduces quadratic functions and provides multiple strategies for solving quadratic equations. Students will learn to graph parabolas, identify key features including vertex, axis of symmetry, and maximum or minimum values, and work with different forms of quadratic functions. The chapter teaches four methods for solving quadratic equations: graphing, factoring, using square roots, completing the square, and the quadratic formula. Students will also learn about the discriminant to determine the nature of roots and encounter complex numbers and the imaginary unit when solving equations with no real solutions.
