# Quiz: Exponents and Powers

Test your understanding of exponents, powers, and radical expressions with these questions.

#### 1. What is the value of any non-zero number raised to the power of zero?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Zero
2. One
3. The number itself
4. Undefined
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Any non-zero number raised to the power of zero equals 1. This follows from the pattern of decreasing exponents: when you divide by the base repeatedly (like 2³ = 8, 2² = 4, 2¹ = 2), continuing the pattern gives 2⁰ = 1. This rule holds for any base except zero itself, which is undefined.

#### 2. Which expression correctly represents the negative exponent rule?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. b⁻ⁿ = -bⁿ
2. b⁻ⁿ = 1/bⁿ
3. b⁻ⁿ = b/n
4. b⁻ⁿ = n/b
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The negative exponent rule states that b⁻ⁿ = 1/bⁿ, meaning a negative exponent represents the reciprocal of the base raised to the positive exponent. Option A incorrectly applies the negative sign to the result. Options C and D confuse exponents with division operations. For example, 2⁻³ = 1/2³ = 1/8.

#### 3. When multiplying x⁵ · x³, what is the simplified result?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. x¹⁵
2. x⁸
3. x²
4. 2x⁸
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Using the Product Rule for Exponents, when multiplying powers with the same base, you add the exponents: x⁵ · x³ = x⁵⁺³ = x⁸. Option A incorrectly multiplies the exponents (5 × 3 = 15). Option C incorrectly subtracts the exponents. Option D incorrectly adds a coefficient of 2.

#### 4. A scientist measures a bacteria sample at 0.0000047 meters. How would this be written in scientific notation?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 4.7 × 10⁻⁶
2. 4.7 × 10⁶
3. 47 × 10⁻⁷
4. 0.47 × 10⁻⁵
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. To convert 0.0000047 to scientific notation, move the decimal point 6 places to the right to get 4.7, and since we moved right, the exponent is negative: 4.7 × 10⁻⁶. Option B has a positive exponent, which would represent a large number. Options C and D don't follow the scientific notation format where 1 ≤ |a| < 10.

#### 5. Simplify the expression (x²)⁵.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. x⁷
2. x¹⁰
3. x³²
4. 5x²
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Using the Power Rule for Exponents, when raising a power to another power, multiply the exponents: (x²)⁵ = x²·⁵ = x¹⁰. Option A incorrectly adds the exponents (2 + 5 = 7). Option C incorrectly raises 2 to the power of 5 (2⁵ = 32). Option D treats the outer exponent as a coefficient.

#### 6. What does the expression √49 equal?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 24.5
2. 7
3. ±7
4. 49²
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The square root symbol √ represents the principal (positive) square root, so √49 = 7 because 7² = 49. While both 7 and -7 when squared equal 49, by convention the square root symbol gives only the positive value. Option A incorrectly divides 49 by 2. Option C includes both roots, which is not the standard meaning of the radical symbol. Option D represents 49 squared, not its square root.

#### 7. Simplify y⁷/y³.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. y⁴
2. y¹⁰
3. y²¹
4. 7/3
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Using the Quotient Rule for Exponents, when dividing powers with the same base, subtract the exponents: y⁷/y³ = y⁷⁻³ = y⁴. Option B incorrectly adds the exponents (7 + 3 = 10). Option C incorrectly multiplies the exponents (7 × 3 = 21). Option D treats the expression as pure numerical division.

#### 8. Which of the following expressions is NOT a polynomial?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 3x² + 5x - 7
2. x⁴ - 2x² + 1
3. 1/x + 2
4. 7
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. A polynomial must have only non-negative integer exponents. The expression 1/x can be rewritten as x⁻¹, which has a negative exponent, so it is not a polynomial. Options A and B are polynomials with positive integer exponents. Option D is a constant polynomial (degree 0), which is valid.

#### 9. To simplify √72, you would first factor it as 36 × 2. What is the reasoning behind choosing these factors?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 36 and 2 are both even numbers
2. 36 is the largest perfect square that divides 72
3. 36 and 2 add up to 38
4. 2 is a prime number
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. When simplifying radicals, we look for the largest perfect square factor because we can take its square root and move it outside the radical. Since 36 = 6², we can write √72 = √(36 × 2) = 6√2. While option A is true, being even is not the key criterion. Options C and D mention irrelevant properties that don't help with simplification.

#### 10. If you multiply (3 × 10⁴) · (2 × 10⁵), what is the result in scientific notation?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 5 × 10⁹
2. 6 × 10⁹
3. 6 × 10²⁰
4. 5 × 10²⁰
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. When multiplying numbers in scientific notation, multiply the coefficients and add the exponents: (3 × 10⁴) · (2 × 10⁵) = (3 · 2) × 10⁴⁺⁵ = 6 × 10⁹. Option A incorrectly adds the coefficients (3 + 2 = 5). Options C and D incorrectly multiply the exponents instead of adding them (4 × 5 = 20).
