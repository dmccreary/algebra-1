# Factoring Polynomials

## Summary

This chapter develops students' ability to factor polynomial expressions using multiple techniques. Building on knowledge of special products from the previous chapter, students will learn to reverse the multiplication process through factoring by greatest common factor, factoring trinomials, recognizing and factoring difference of squares and perfect square trinomials, and using the grouping method. The chapter culminates with the zero product property and solving equations by factoring, connecting algebraic manipulation to equation solving.
