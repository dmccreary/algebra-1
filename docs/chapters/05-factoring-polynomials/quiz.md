#### 1. What is the greatest common factor (GCF) of the polynomial 12x³ + 18x²?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 3x
2. 6x
3. 6x²
4. 12x³
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. To find the GCF, identify the GCF of the coefficients (GCF(12,18) = 6) and the lowest power of x that appears in all terms (x²). Therefore, the GCF is 6x². Option A only includes part of the numerical GCF. Option B has the correct numerical part but the wrong variable power. Option D is one of the original terms, not the GCF.

    **Concept Tested:** Factoring by GCF

#### 2. Factor the trinomial x² + 7x + 12.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. (x + 2)(x + 6)
2. (x + 1)(x + 12)
3. (x + 3)(x + 4)
4. (x + 7)(x + 5)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. We need two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to 7. The numbers 3 and 4 satisfy both conditions: 3 × 4 = 12 and 3 + 4 = 7, giving us (x + 3)(x + 4). Option A gives numbers that add to 8, not 7. Option B gives numbers that add to 13. Option D contains numbers that don't multiply to 12.

#### 3. Which expression demonstrates the difference of squares pattern?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. x² + 25
2. x² - 10x + 25
3. 9x² - 16
4. x² + 6x + 9
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The difference of squares has the form a² - b². The expression 9x² - 16 = (3x)² - 4², which factors as (3x + 4)(3x - 4). Option A is a sum of squares (cannot be factored using real numbers). Options B and D are perfect square trinomials, not difference of squares.

#### 4. Factor x² - 25 completely.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. (x - 5)²
2. (x + 5)²
3. (x - 5)(x + 5)
4. (x + 5)(x - 5)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. This is a difference of squares: x² - 25 = x² - 5² = (x + 5)(x - 5). Note that options C and D are mathematically equivalent due to the commutative property, but D follows the standard form (a + b)(a - b). Options A and B are perfect squares that would expand to trinomials, not the original binomial.

#### 5. Which trinomial is a perfect square?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. x² + 10x + 25
2. x² + 7x + 12
3. x² - 5x - 14
4. x² + 3x + 9
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. A perfect square trinomial has the form a² ± 2ab + b². For x² + 10x + 25: first term x² and last term 25 = 5² are perfect squares, and the middle term 10x = 2(x)(5) = 2ab. This factors as (x + 5)². Options B and C are factorable trinomials but not perfect squares. Option D has perfect square first and last terms, but 3x ≠ 2(x)(3) = 6x.

#### 6. Factor ax + ay + bx + by by grouping.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. (a + b)(x - y)
2. (a - b)(x + y)
3. a(x + y) + b(x + y)
4. (a + b)(x + y)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. Group the terms: (ax + ay) + (bx + by). Factor each group: a(x + y) + b(x + y). Now factor out the common binomial (x + y): (a + b)(x + y). Option C shows the intermediate step but isn't fully factored. Options A and B have incorrect signs in the binomial factors.

#### 7. Solve the equation x² + 5x + 6 = 0 by factoring.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. x = 2 or x = 3
2. x = -2 or x = -3
3. x = 1 or x = 6
4. x = -1 or x = -6
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Factor the trinomial: (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0. Using the zero product property, set each factor equal to zero: x + 2 = 0 or x + 3 = 0, giving x = -2 or x = -3. Option A has the wrong signs (positive instead of negative). Options C and D use incorrect factor pairs for the constant 6.

#### 8. What does the zero product property state?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. If a + b = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0
2. If a - b = 0, then a = b
3. If a × b = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0
4. If a ÷ b = 0, then a = 0
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The zero product property states that if the product of two or more factors equals zero, then at least one of the factors must equal zero: if ab = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0 (or both). This fundamental property allows us to solve factored equations. Options A, B, and D describe other algebraic properties but not the zero product property.

#### 9. Factor 2x³ - 50x completely.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 2x(x² - 25)
2. 2x(x - 5)(x + 5)
3. (2x - 10)(x + 5)
4. 2(x³ - 25x)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. First factor out the GCF of 2x: 2x(x² - 25). Then recognize that x² - 25 is a difference of squares that factors further: 2x(x + 5)(x - 5). Option A is only partially factored (didn't factor the difference of squares). Option C doesn't preserve the original expression. Option D only factors out 2, not the complete GCF.

#### 10. When factoring the trinomial 3x² + 11x + 6 using the AC method, what two numbers multiply to AC and add to b?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 3 and 6
2. 11 and 1
3. 9 and 2
4. 2 and 9
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. In the AC method, AC = 3 × 6 = 18, and b = 11. We need two numbers that multiply to 18 and add to 11. The numbers 2 and 9 work: 2 × 9 = 18 and 2 + 9 = 11. Option A gives the original a and c values, not the numbers we need. Option B doesn't multiply to 18. Option C is the same as option D (order doesn't matter for this step).
