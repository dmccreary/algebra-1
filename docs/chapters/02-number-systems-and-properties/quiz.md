#### 1. What are integers?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Only positive whole numbers
2. All whole numbers including positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero
3. Only numbers that can be written as fractions
4. Numbers that include decimals and fractions
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Integers are the set of all whole numbers including positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero: {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. Option A describes only natural numbers (positive integers), option C describes rational numbers, and option D incorrectly includes non-whole numbers.

#### 2. Which property states that $a + b = b + a$?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Associative Property
2. Distributive Property
3. Commutative Property
4. Identity Property
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The Commutative Property of Addition states that changing the order of addends does not change the sum: $a + b = b + a$. The Associative Property deals with grouping, the Distributive Property involves multiplication over addition, and the Identity Property states that adding zero doesn't change a number.

    **Concept Tested:** Commutative Property

    **See:** [Commutative Property](index.md#commutative-property)

#### 3. What is the absolute value of -12?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. -12
2. 0
3. 12
4. 24
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, always expressed as a non-negative value. Since -12 is 12 units away from zero, $|-12| = 12$. Absolute value represents distance, which is always positive or zero, never negative.

    **Concept Tested:** Absolute Value

    **See:** [Absolute Value](index.md#absolute-value)

#### 4. Which set of numbers includes all integers and all fractions?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Natural numbers
2. Whole numbers
3. Rational numbers
4. Irrational numbers
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as the quotient of two integers (a fraction), which includes all integers (since any integer $n$ can be written as $\frac{n}{1}$) and all fractions. Natural numbers are only positive counting numbers, whole numbers include zero but no negatives or fractions, and irrational numbers cannot be written as fractions.

    **Concept Tested:** Rational Numbers

    **See:** [Rational Numbers](index.md#rational-numbers)

#### 5. The distributive property $a(b + c) = ab + ac$ combines which two operations?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Addition and subtraction
2. Multiplication and addition
3. Division and multiplication
4. Exponents and multiplication
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The distributive property shows how multiplication distributes over addition (or subtraction). It states that multiplying a number by a sum is the same as multiplying the number by each addend and then adding the products: $a(b + c) = ab + ac$. This property is essential for expanding and simplifying algebraic expressions.

    **Concept Tested:** Distributive Property

    **See:** [Distributive Property](index.md#distributive-property)

#### 6. Which number is the additive identity?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 1
2. 0
3. -1
4. Any negative number
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The additive identity is zero (0) because adding zero to any number does not change that number: $a + 0 = a$. The number 1 is the multiplicative identity (not additive), and negative numbers are not identity elements.

    **Concept Tested:** Identity Property

    **See:** [Identity Property](index.md#identity-property)

#### 7. Using the associative property, $(2 + 3) + 4$ equals which of the following?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. $2 + (3 + 4)$
2. $(2 + 4) + 3$
3. $2 \times 3 + 4$
4. Both A and B
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. The Associative Property states that the grouping of numbers doesn't affect the sum (or product). Both $(2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4) = 9$ and regrouping as $(2 + 4) + 3$ also equals $9$. When adding three or more numbers, any grouping gives the same result. Option C changes the operation to multiplication, which is different.

    **Concept Tested:** Associative Property

    **See:** [Associative Property](index.md#associative-property)

#### 8. On a number line, which direction represents positive integers?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To the left of zero
2. To the right of zero
3. Below zero
4. Above zero
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. On a horizontal number line, positive integers are located to the right of zero, while negative integers are to the left. The number line is typically drawn horizontally (not vertically), so "above" and "below" are not the standard orientations. This visualization helps understand the ordering and magnitude of numbers.

    **Concept Tested:** Number Line

    **See:** [Number Line](index.md#number-line)

#### 9. What is the additive inverse of 7?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 7
2. 0
3. -7
4. $\frac{1}{7}$
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The additive inverse of a number is the number that, when added to the original, gives zero. Since $7 + (-7) = 0$, the additive inverse of 7 is -7. The Inverse Property of Addition states that every number has an additive inverse. Option D ($\frac{1}{7}$) would be the multiplicative inverse (reciprocal), not the additive inverse.

    **Concept Tested:** Inverse Property

    **See:** [Inverse Property](index.md#inverse-property)

---

#### 10. Which of the following is an example of the distributive property?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. $5 + 3 = 3 + 5$
2. $3(4 + 2) = 3 \times 4 + 3 \times 2$
3. $(2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4)$
4. $7 + 0 = 7$
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The distributive property shows that $a(b + c) = ab + ac$. In this example, $3(4 + 2) = 3 \times 4 + 3 \times 2$ demonstrates distributing the multiplication of 3 over the addition inside the parentheses. Option A shows the commutative property, option C shows the associative property, and option D shows the identity property.
