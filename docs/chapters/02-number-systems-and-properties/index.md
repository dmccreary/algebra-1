# Number Systems and Properties

## Summary

This chapter explores the different types of numbers that form the foundation of algebra and the properties that govern mathematical operations. Students will learn about integers, rational numbers, and real numbers, understanding how these number systems build upon each other. The chapter also covers fundamental properties including commutative, associative, distributive, identity, and inverse properties, along with representations of numbers on the number line and coordinate system.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 14 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Commutative Property
2. Associative Property
3. Distributive Property
4. Identity Property
5. Inverse Property
6. Integers
7. Rational Numbers
8. Real Numbers
9. Absolute Value
10. Number Line
11. Coordinate System
12. Base
